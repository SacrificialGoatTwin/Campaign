Eryndor — The Magic-UI World.
The new world is called Eryndor, a planet not unlike Earth in climate and geology, but layered with ancient magic. Everyone in Eryndor possesses a magical User Interface (UI) — a semi-ethereal overlay that reveals stats, skills, spells, and soul-deep traits. However, this UI is informational only by default. To modify it — to level up, evolve skills, or unlock new abilities — one must use a rare artifact: a Soulbound Plaque.
These plaques are:
Issued by guilds, royal decrees, or divine missions.
Crafted illegally in secret, often by Voidcraft heretics or rogue ley-mages, but to make one is not easy so illegal ones are very very very rare.
Highly controlled — possession without sponsorship is outlawed in many kingdoms (especially the Solari Dominion).
They convert XP (experience, but also life energy, achievements, and metaphysical growth) into structured upgrades. Without one, you're locked out of progress.
