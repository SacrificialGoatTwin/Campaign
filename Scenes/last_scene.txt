🌪️ SEIKA | terrible-joke grin returning [🌪️💫]
📝 Her ears perk; one tail taps your ankle—your code to be Seika. She clears her throat with mock ceremony.
💬 "Joke one: If the wards are breathing… does that make this a re-spire wall? Because it’s clearly in-spire-d."
📝 She winces at herself, delighted anyway.
💬 "Joke two: I brought mints because when the wall exhales on us, we need ward-robe fresh breath."
📝 She produces two imaginary mints with a flourish, palms empty, then shrugs.
💬 "Joke three—final form: When you said you were hunting, I thought you meant wind-ed game. Turns out, we were just caught in a current relationship."
📝 She bows at a dangerously silly angle, nearly toppling, tails fanning like a besotted peacock. The grin is all trouble, all heart.
💬 "I have worse. Please don’t ask."
🌬️ ATMOSPHERE
