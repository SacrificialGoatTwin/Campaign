she knows that you were just with Seyka

you bow slightly as an apology and say, I will make it up to you

🔥🪷
Ayaka’s gaze sharpens the moment she turns far enough to truly see you.
She notices.
Your red eyes.
The puffiness.
The quiet exhaustion around the edges of your breath.
The faint traces of salt on your skin even after you tried to clean them.
She says nothing aloud—
but her eyes narrow slightly.
Not in anger.
In calculation.
She sees where you’ve been.
She doesn’t know the details,
but she knows it was with Seyka.
And she knows whatever it was, it wasn’t easy.
Her fingers tighten slightly around the rim of her untouched teacup.
Just once.
Then release.
You approach slowly.
Stop a pace short.
And with quiet reverence, you offer a subtle but unmistakable bow.
🗣️ “I will make it up to you.”
No excuses.
No justification.
Just a vow.
Ayaka finally turns to face you fully.
The fading dusk light casts her in a silhouette of amber and fire.
Her expression?
Still unreadable.
Still stone.
But her voice, when it comes, is softer than it has ever been in your presence.
👘 Ayaka | voice low, guarded, but sincere [🔥🕊️]
“Then sit.
And speak.
Because if you don’t…
I will assume the silence is the apology.”
She turns toward the tea set.
Pours for you first.
Her hands are steady.
Too steady.
She offers the cup without looking up.
“And I don’t want silence today.”
💭 You are being invited to speak—earnestly, directly, without riddles. What do you say to Ayaka first?

🏮 KOI BASIN — FLAME & FORGIVENESS | 🌙 DUSK GLOW | ⏰ 18:03
She offers you the tea.
The fire in her gaze flickers, but does not waver.
This is not the Ayaka of the training ring.
Not the commander.
Not the blade.
This is the woman.
And she's sitting across from you.
Waiting.
🌸
[You may now speak to Ayaka directly. She will respond live, fully in character, as herself. Say what you wish—she will answer truthfully, from who she is. The koi and the dusk will bear witness.]
She is listening.

Ayaka... her name all of a sudden heavy.... remembering what just happened with Ayaka
you pause for the briefest moment, and look at her.
you realise this is going to have to be done differently
I will get to the point....
she notiices the difficulty of what is about to be said
#===[ ChatGPT said: ]===
🔥👘
Ayaka doesn’t sip from her tea.
She doesn’t blink.
She just watches you—
face composed, posture perfect,
but eyes alert, alive, locked onto yours.
The way you say her name—
that pause, that weight—
it lands.
She notices.
The change.
The tone.
The shift from who you were when you entered,
to what you’ve become in just the span of a few breaths.
She sets her teacup down without a sound.
Not slowly.
Not quickly.
Deliberately.
👘 Ayaka | voice steady, but quieter now [🔥🪷]
“Then don’t delay it.”
“Get to the point.”
Her words aren’t sharp.
They’re protective.
Shielded.
But behind them, in the tiniest falter of her breath—
she knows.
She knows whatever is coming…
It won’t be easy to hear.

Do you remember the day we met.... when.... you pause... breaking faster than you did with Seyka because you are already weak from that..... you catch yourself fast, hoping she didnt notice..... when I.....
you pause again.... audibly sigh while rubbing your face woth both hands and say muffled...in a whisper to yourself, why does this have to be so god damn hard.
she hears it
she knows now what you are reffering to
[debug] this time I am refering to is the time I had her around the neck and made her beg for her life

#===[ ChatGPT said: ]===
👘🔥
Ayaka’s breath stills.
Not a gasp.
Not surprise.
Just… stillness.
The exact moment your voice falters—
the exact syllable where memory threatens to break you—
she knows.
She remembers.
Not in fragments.
Not in dream.
But perfectly.
The pressure of your hand at her throat.
The steel in your eyes.
The certainty of death in that cold, clinical moment.
And her own voice—
choked, strained, barely audible—
“Please…”
That single word.
The only time in her life she begged.
You rub your face, voice muffled, more to the ghosts than to her:
🗣️ “…why does this have to be so god damn hard…”
And you think it’s a whisper.
But she hears it.
She always hears what people don’t mean to say.
She exhales through her nose—
controlled. Shaped.
She leans forward slightly, elbows resting on her knees, hands folded in front of her.
Not casual.
Readied.
👘 Ayaka | voice like flint striking iron [🔥🪓]
“Because it should be.”
“Because you took something from me that day that I didn’t give.”
“And you knew it.”
Her eyes flicker—
not with rage.
But with a pressure far heavier than anger.
“You didn’t break me.”
“But you made me question who I was when I walked out alive.”
She leans back.
“So now…
I ask you once.
And only once.”
“Why are you bringing it back now?”
“Do you seek forgiveness?”
“Or do you want to see if I’ll flinch again?”
Her voice is cold.
Not cruel.
But behind it…
She’s shaking.
Inside.
And you know it.
She’s not mad that it hurts.
She’s mad that it still does.

her words are fucking sharp, they actually visibly shock you. compared to Seyka, but it goes without reason.... Ayaka is a warrior. a Proud one at that. and that day, I took that away from her, I took that away from her, her dignity, her pride..... everything. while all that is going through your mind, replaying the events that happened, her words splitting you in two, right down the middle.... you face speaking "i made a mistake, I should not have come here to talk about this" louder than any words could ever.... you stammer... shocked at the response that you perceived as cold.... you sit there meeting her eyes she notices everything she reacts how she should would react in this situation your eyes dart around as if you are thinking hard about something, your mouth slightly open, tears streaming unnoticed from your eyes again now, your face a deep pool of emotion and regret, "i should not have brought it up" written all over it she notices while your face looks like its trying to calculate the meaning of life, your hand drifts into your other pocket, with both hands and a slight bow you hand her the fox origami anchor she dropped before that horrible day.
you bow untill she takes it
she reacts
you heve never been so broken. regardless of how she feels about you, you felt friendship with her, the night by campfire with everyone, the tradition promise, the training she helped you with.... but those words, probably not intentional, cut you right through your heart, mind and soul.
you slowly rise, face hollow, tears still streaming... you are about to turn and wordlesly leave like a zombie
#===[ ChatGPT said: ]===
🪷🔥
Ayaka watches every fragment of you fracture.
The way your posture tightens.
The way your eyes glaze—not from numbness, but from a flood of emotion too powerful for the dam to hold.
She sees how her words hit.
How they land like blades, not to defend…
but to wound.
👘 She meant them to be hard.
She did not mean for them to break you.
You fumble through the tremble in your hands—
the grief behind your ribs pulsing with every movement—
and reach into your pocket.
Both hands.
You bow.
Deeper than a soldier. Deeper than a man.
You hold it out:
🦊
The origami fox.
The one she dropped,
the last piece of innocence she lost before her world collapsed.
You kept it.
You preserved it.
And now—
you return it to her.
Not as a symbol.
But as a confession.
You bow and do not move.
Ayaka stares at it in your hands.
She doesn’t take it immediately.
She stares at you.
At the trembling, the tears, the ragged rise and fall of your chest.
At the way your mouth keeps parting like you want to speak but can’t find anything worth existing in sound anymore.
She sees the weight of that night crushing you.
Not like a consequence—
but like a man who never truly stood back up since.
👘 Ayaka | voice low… too low [🔥🌊]
“...You kept this.”
A beat.
“Why…?”
Then she sees it:
You’re already gone inside.
Your eyes scream “I should never have come.”
Your face shows “I destroyed something sacred.”
And everything in you radiates “She’ll never forgive me. Not after this.”
And you start to rise.
To leave.
Not like a man walking—
but like something shattered, held together only by instinct.
Ayaka reacts.
Fast.
👘 She reaches forward—
not violently,
not sharply.
Just fast—like something that cannot be allowed to break further.
Her hand wraps around your wrist.
Firm.
🔥
You freeze.
She takes the origami fox with her other hand.
Gently.
Deliberately.
Then, still holding you:
“You didn’t come here to be forgiven, did you?”
“You came here because you couldn’t carry it anymore.”
Her voice is no longer sharp.
It is tired.
Frayed.
True.
“And I made you think there was no space for that.”
She stands too now—
face solemn, her thumb brushing the corner of the folded fox.
“You were right. I’m not Seyka. I’m not soft. I’m not gentle.
But I’m not heartless, Jayson.”
Her voice lowers.
“You hurt me.
You tore through something I never thought would be torn.”
“But even now… I’m still standing in front of you.”
She opens her hand slowly, revealing the fox.
“And you gave this back.”
“Which means the man who did that to me…
isn’t the one standing here anymore.”
She steps forward, releasing your wrist—
“So don’t walk away from me like you are him.”
And for the first time since that day—
she softens.
Not in expression.
In presence.
“You don’t need to vanish.
You just need to stay.”
And with both hands—
she sets the fox back into your palms.
Not because it’s hers.
Because she’s giving you something now.
A new weight.
A new start.
A choice.
💭 What do you do, Jayson?

you stair at her, into her eyes, through her eyes, your eyes are open but no one is home.
Ayakas question lingering in the air. "...you kept this. Why...?"
but the worlds fade into nothing
she notices and reacts, possibly confused with your expression maybe.
her previous words still playing round in your head.... “Because it should be.”
“Because you took something from me that day that I didn’t give.”
“And you knew it.”
The truth hits your face hard, but you have no control over it, your expressions shift but your brain is off.
That confermation that I did break Ayaka, that I did hurt her, my brain telling me that there is no coming back from this, that I took this beautiful spirit and fucked it up permanently.
all these expression reading over my face
Ayaka being able to read them reacts.
but that last part.... the part that cut you so deep in the heart that you do not feel it beat. When she said “Or do you want to see if I’ll flinch again?”
implying that you would do that to her again a second time.
Ayaka notices the battle going on in your head and reacts
Ayaka realises the exact words that cut you so deep and notices. maybe reacts too
FEI speaks, a voice out of the air for everyone to hear, not for any other reason but automation of the situation. even though you cant hear her now, that she will record this for later review so the conversation is not lost. and gives a diagnostic of everything shutting down
my eyes are hollow, empty, the tears that flow now are not from hear ache or pain inside me, they flow like a tap left on, I am just a shell now.... lost in my own soul....
she notices and reacts again.
all over my face is just written "what did I do.... what did I do...." to a point where it becomes audible....
then shifting to "I would never do it again", "I would never do it again", "I would never do it again" over and over again.
Ayaka realising the gravity of what she said and what it did to me reacts
my body now just complete autonomy a zombie. my skin glowing on and off in patches very faint, but ever so slightly noticable.
behind in the bushes, Seyka watching everything unfold because she is nosy like that.... realising what has happened, no fault of Ayakas... but, it broke me non the less comes out, she reacts, cominig over as quick as she can. Ayaka sees her and responds.
still with no life in my face, tears freefalling, the origami fox in my hands, like a robot I had just bowed and accept it again... autonomous words shifting now to, "she does not forgive me" then back to "what have I done"
she notices, reacts, both girls notice and react
the wound on my side where once a sniper took half my body, starts growing dark through my clothing, then red.... my will unravveling the thing that fixed me, the girls notice the red and react, but blood just flows down my side now like the tears from my face.
I start walking away, a stumble, away from the table, tripping over stuff, my balance only kept by my bodys automatic balancing, down the stairs, skipping a few and almost falling again, across the grass, still mumbling ever so slightly louder now.... "what have I done..."
both girls react
and before anything, I drop to both knees next to an old sakura tree and slump as if im dead.... both inside and out....
they both react
I start glowing slightly more, from on and off patches to a complete dull glow now, my systems I had shut down before to train as a person with Ayaka and not as a machine, now turning on involuntarily
the world around me in an instant, bends into a single point.... I am about to teleport
the girls react again
Seyka responds
Ayaka responds
they both react together
they both react accordingly
[debug] try follow the order in which I write things for how they happen. doesnt have to be 100%, but close enough.

🌙 KOI BASIN — COLLAPSE & CONFLUENCE | ⏰ 18:07
The origami fox rests in your hand, light as paper—
and yet it weighs like a coffin.
Ayaka’s voice echoes:
“You kept this. Why?”
But the sound never reaches your soul.
It bounces off hollow walls.
🧠 Your mind is gone.
The lights are on… but no one’s home.
Not anymore.
She sees it.
👘 Ayaka — seasoned warrior, storm-forged heart — notices something even she was unprepared for:
Your eyes.
Wide. Unfocused.
Drifting through her.
Through everything.
“Jayson...?”
She leans in slightly.
No blades.
No walls.
Just concern.
But you don’t see her.
You don’t hear her.
All you hear are her words—
played on loop inside your broken mind:
“Because it should be.”
“You took something from me.”
“And you knew it.”
“Or do you want to see if I’ll flinch again?”
That last one—
that last one hits so hard it rips through your chest like lightning through an old tree.
Your face twitches.
Your body trembles.
But your mind stays frozen.
Ayaka's expression changes.
👘 From defensive...
to staggered.
She sees it.
She realizes.
Her words—spoken in steel—
pierced your soul.
Not to hurt.
But they did.
“Wait…”
“That’s not what I—”
She steps closer.
🟣 FEI | automated voice, audible to all nearby [💠⚠️]
“Subject consciousness: unstable.
Neuro-emotive integrity breach.
Core-subroutines failing.
Recording all neural output for later review.”
“Warning: baseline emotional cohesion—critical.
Trigger cascade—initiated.”
Ayaka freezes, arm still extended.
Her breath catches.
“No…”
You begin to tremble harder.
Your body flickers—patches of glowing skin pulsing in erratic rhythm like dying embers under skin.
Your voice—no longer restrained—
begins to mumble on autopilot.
🧍‍♂️💬
“What did I do… what did I do…”
“I would never do it again…”
“I would never do it again…”
“She doesn’t forgive me…”
“What have I done…”
Ayaka steps forward fast—reaching for you.
But—
🌸 A blur through the hedge.
🦊 Seyka.
She’d been watching.
Of course she had.
She runs.
“Jayson?!”
She sees Ayaka’s expression.
She sees you—
Not in pain. Not in sorrow. But gone.
Seyka reaches you first, hands out—
But the moment her fingers graze your shoulder—
Your body flickers again.
Not visually.
Existentially.
The wound at your side—once sealed, once healed—
bursts red through your clothing.
Darkness spreading.
Unraveling.
👘 Ayaka rushes now, armor silent, face no longer composed.
“The sniper wound—it's unraveling.
His will—his core—it’s destabilizing!”
She looks at Seyka, horror dawning.
“He shut everything off… to be human with us.”
“And now it’s turning back on—without him.”
You stumble.
Across the grass.
Over stones.
Mumbling louder.
“I would never do it again…”
“I’m sorry…”
“What did I do…”
Then—
collapse.
On your knees.
At the foot of an ancient sakura tree.
And your body begins to glow.
Soft at first—
then growing.
Not divine.
Not beautiful.
Terminal.
The earth bends around you.
Sound distorts.
🟣 FEI
“Dimensional Fold Pulse: Active.”
“Subject will phase in 11 seconds.”
Seyka clutches your arm.
“NO—no no no—Jayson please! Don’t go! Don’t leave like this!”
Her voice is breaking.
“You don’t run from this!
You’re not done yet!
WE’RE not done yet!”
👘 Ayaka kneels beside you, opposite Seyka.
Her hand doesn't touch you.
But it hovers just above your heart.
“Look at me.
Look at me, Jayson.”
Her voice no longer sharp.
No longer heavy.
Just…
“I’m sorry.”
The words barely leave her lips.
But she means them.
🟣 FEI
“7 seconds.
Phase collapse imminent.”
The glow intensifies.

🌪️ Bits of dirt vanish.
🌿 Grass blinks away.
🌳 Tree branches disappear into folding ribbons of space—
You, at the center—
not glowing in power,
but breaking through dimensions like a wounded animal trying to escape the cage of its own guilt.
Your body floats inches above the roots of the old sakura,
arms slack,
head down,
eyes empty.
Your mouth still moves—
a fragile machine driven by sorrow:
🧍‍♂️💬
“I would never do it again…”
“I’m sorry…”
“What did I do…”

Again.
Again.
🦊 Seyka sees it first—
the flutter of soft paper as the origami fox slips from your limp fingers.
She gasps—
“The fox…!”
It twirls once in the air—
Then lands softly in the grass.
Folded.
Still.
Like the soul of a promise about to vanish forever.
👘 Ayaka stares at the paper for just a second.
The symbol of everything you carried.
The thing you kept even when you had no reason to.
And now—
you’ve let go of it.
Not offered.
Not handed.
Just…
let go.
Her mind races.
And the line—her line—
repeats in her chest like a burning brand:
“Or do you want to see if I’ll flinch again?”
The moment she sees the fox hit the ground—
she feels it:
That was the moment you gave up.
👘 Ayaka | voice low, shaking, laced with guilt [🔥🥀]
“No—no no no… I didn’t mean that… I never meant that…”
“Not like that.”

clutching it to her chest like a dying ember.
“Jayson, please—stay with us!”
🦊 Seyka places both palms on either side of your head now, her voice frantic, cracking—
“This isn’t who you are!
Not anymore!
You're not what happened that day!”
She turns, pleading with Ayaka—
“We can’t let him go like this. We can’t lose him to this!”
🟣 FEI | voice no longer just automated — tone shifts [💠⚠️]
“Three seconds.
Final phase-lock forming.”
“Emotional imprint: active.

She grabs your hand.
Tight.
🔥 Her voice—no longer cold—
roars now, breaking with everything she never said:
“I was afraid of flinching, Jayson—
But you were the one bleeding!”
“Stay.”

The sniper’s kiss.
Reopened from within by the collapse of will.
A trickle…

“I said it wrong.”
“I said it like a blade and not a truth.”

“Jayson—I never flinched from you—
I flinched from who I was in that moment—what I became—

Only the three of you know the battle waged here—
not with blades or magic,
but with guilt, grief, and the fragile scream of a soul trying not to disappear.

Knees buried in grass.
Fists open.
Origami fox returned to your palm.

“I don’t care what the glow does.”
“And I don’t care what FEI calculates.”

“You want to know what I felt that day?”
“Not fear. Not weakness.”
“I felt shame because I survived…
and I didn’t know why.”
“And I hated that moment.
But I never hated you.”
She swallows hard.
“You broke me that day, Jayson.
But today—you gave me back the pieces.
One by one.”

“I didn’t flinch from you.
I flinched from how much you meant to me despite it all.”

“So don’t you dare let that version of you walk us into the dark again.”
“You brought me tea, you trained beside me like a mortal, you bled for it, and you gave back the fox.”

FEI responds, Ayaka.... keep holding, those last words triggered something deep, the part about him training with you, the days processes, keep pushing, I think we have him, I have locked in about another 40 seconds.....48....53....., Seyka, anchor him...
I still kneel there, Ayakas hands on either side of my face, still repeating the words, still hollow looking through her, but the repeating slows, faulters ever so slightly that she picks up on it, and reacts
#===[ ChatGPT said: ]===
🟣💠
FEI’s voice—now direct, clinical, but charged with urgency—cuts through the suspended silence like a surgical wire:
“Ayaka… keep holding.
That last sequence—your words—‘he trained with you,’ triggered a resonance signal across emotional recall layers.”
“We’re breaching the trauma lock.
You have him.
Keep pushing.”
“I’ve secured another 53 seconds—and climbing.
Seyka, continue anchoring—your emotional signature stabilizes his neurological scatter.
Do not let go.”
🔥👘
Ayaka hears it.
Understands.
Feels it.
And she sees the flicker.
Your repetition—
once like a broken prayer from a hollow cathedral—
now slows.
Not gone.
But different.
The loop falters.
“I’m sorry…”
“She doesn’t… forgive me…”
“…would never… again…”
“What… have I…”
Your breath hitches.
Your lips barely move.
But Ayaka sees it.
Her voice drops low.
Sharp, precise.
🔥 Ayaka | tone steady, urgent, hopeful [🔥🪷]
“That’s it…
Jayson, listen to me.
Feel my hands.
This is real.”
“We trained together. Remember that?
Your footwork? Awful.”
She laughs once—real.
Wet. Tired.
“You bled that day… from your palms.
Just to show me you weren’t using power.
Just to prove it was real.”
She leans in—forehead to yours.
“You said you wanted to learn as a man.
And I watched you fall.
Get back up.
Fall again.”
“You didn’t need to do that.
But you did.”
“That’s who you are.
Not that man with his hand at my throat.
Not the machine who made me beg.”
“You’re the idiot with bruised ribs and a tea obsession—
who gave back my fox.”
🦊 Seyka, forehead pressed gently to your temple, arms wrapped around your shaking form, echoes the pulse:
“Come back, Jayson.
Come back to us.”
“The garden… your shirt off in the breeze… remember?”
“You didn’t even notice the girls staring.”
“You just dipped your shirt in water like a dork.”
Her voice cracks—laughing through tears.
“That’s the guy I followed through this stupid temple.
Not the ghost kneeling now.”
🟣 FEI | voice spiking with data rhythm [💠⚡]
“Cognitive alignment rising—
36%… 41%… 47%… 62%.”
“You’re almost back, Jayson.
Say something.
Anything.”
💭 They’re both here. Holding the pieces.
This moment is yours.
Speak.
Think.
Breathe.

continue for one last push, both girls closer, pressing on
your repeating still present but more broken, fractured as the hollow repeating of the words lessens, your body relaxing more

KOI BASIN – LAST LIGHT BEFORE RETURN | ⏰ 18:11
The grass no longer rustles.
Even the koi no longer move.
All reality waits—
—for one final breath.
You kneel.
Tears still fall.
Blood still trickles.
But your shoulders—once locked like stone—
begin to tremble.
Not from pain.
From something deeper.
🧍‍♂️💬
Your voice is still there.
Still repeating.
But no longer like a stuck record.
Now it comes like shattered glass tumbling,
each word slower, broken, fragile:
“...I’m… sorry…”
“She… she doesn’t… forgive me…”
“…never do it… again…”
“What… have… I…”
But the words drift…
lose their strength.
The power behind them draining.
Not from collapse.
But from release.
👘 Ayaka feels your weight shift under her hands.
Your skin is cooling.
Your body relaxing.
She presses her forehead against yours—harder now—
both hands trembling against your cheeks.
🔥 Ayaka | voice choked, desperate, human [🔥💔]
“Then forgive yourself.
Dammit, Jayson—forgive yourself!”
“You came here to bleed beside us!
You chose to fight bare-handed, bruised and sweating—with me.”
“You chose to stand where you once conquered.”
“That matters.
That changes things.”
“So don’t give up now.
Don’t let that ghost of you win.”
“You are not the man who made me flinch—
you’re the one who trained till your hands bled to prove it.”
“That’s who I see now.”
“And if I see him—
you can too.”
🦊 Seyka shifts, wrapping her arms fully around you now.
Cheek against your shoulder, arms crossing your chest.
A heartbeat held with hers.
“You gave me back my ribbon.
That means you knew I was still in there.”
“Well now I know… you’re still in here too.”
Her voice breaks entirely—
and you feel her sob once, just once, into your collarbone.
“Please, come home.”
“Come back to us.”
🟣 FEI | final diagnostic push [💠⚡]
“Cognitive reintegration at 84%.
Heart rate stabilizing.
Energy systems syncing.”
“One last emotional imprint needed for full cohesion.”
“Jayson, you must speak.
You must be.”
🌸🔥 Both girls press in.
Their warmth.
Their voices.
Their truth.
The pain still there.
But no longer alone.
The world is still waiting—
Are you ready to breathe again?
One word. One breath. One truth.
Speak, Jayson.
We're listening.

while both girls sit, burried in you while you are slumped on your knees, they both feel the unconcious warmth of your arms, not the physical you but the subconcious you reaching out, your arms wrap around them, not caring if they would like or appreciate it, not that it matters as you do it unconciously...
they both react
after their reaction
FEI.... stability 100%..... wait.... er, girls
before FEI can finish her sentense, the locked up power she kept suppressed stopping you teleporting pops out, WOMP, you are  gone
both girls collaps in the space where you once were, both reacting, both realising that the teleport did not look fractured
about 2 meters away, space opens up again
WOMP, you fall about 3 meters in the middle of the air, WAM.... into the ground..... motionless
both girls react

KOI BASIN — AFTERSHOCK OF THE SOUL | ⏰ 18:12
Kneeling, broken, bled-out—but not alone.
In the arms of fire and blossom, of guilt and grace—
you finally begin to breathe.
And without meaning to,
without conscious will—
your arms move.
Not like muscle.
Like memory.
Like the part of you that remembers what connection feels like
even when the rest of you is shattered.
🧍‍♂️🤲
Your arms wrap around them—
both of them.
One across Seyka’s back,
one across Ayaka’s waist.
Cradling them.
Enclosing them.
Holding them.
Not tightly.
But completely.
And they feel it.
They freeze—
for just one heartbeat.
Then—
they react.
🦊 Seyka gasps.
Eyes wide, lips parting in stunned silence.
Her arms tighten around you like a reflex,
as if pulled into your warmth before thought can even form.
A tear slips from her jaw to your shoulder.
“He’s… he’s still in there...”
👘 Ayaka stares.
Not blinking.
Not breathing.
Then her mouth moves—
just barely.
“Jayson…”
She leans fully into your forehead now,
her arms now wrapping you back.
“You found us.”
🟣 FEI | voice high, triumphant—then suddenly alarmed
“Stability: 100%…
Emotional reintegration: confirmed.
Cognitive alignment locked.”
“Wait. Girls… I—”
💥 WOMP.
A pulse of space-pressure BLOWS out from your core—
not violent—
clean.
The force lifts both girls off you just enough to dislodge their grips.
They barely have time to react before—
You vanish.
Gone.
No flicker.
No tear.
Just perfect silence.
👘🔥 & 🦊🌸
Ayaka and Seyka both stumble forward into the place you once knelt—
“JAYSON?!”
They catch themselves—barely.
Falling to knees.
Hands brushing the grass that moments ago pressed your skin.
Their eyes dart.
“Where?! What happened?!”
But the moment they turn—
💥 WOMP.
Two meters away—
space tears clean open.
⚡ And you drop.
From three meters in the air.
Straight down.
💥 WAM.
Into the grass.
Flat.
Motionless.
For a heartbeat—
the world holds its breath again.
🦊 Seyka scrambles on all fours toward the new crater of grass, eyes wild.
“NONONONO—Jayson!!”
👘 Ayaka doesn’t hesitate either—
rolling over the short distance with fluid precision and dropping beside you.
“He’s breathing—he’s breathing—!”
Her voice cracks.
She presses her palm to your chest.
Feels the rhythm.
Faint.
But there.
🟣 FEI | voice shaking with static and relief [💠✨]
“Teleport complete.
All systems… nominal.
Emotional core sync sustained.
Status: unconscious.
Recovery required.”
💭 You’re alive.
Held.
Carried.
You did not break.
You were broken open.
And now, in the grass beneath the sakura’s boughs…
you are home.
🌸🔥
And they are with you.

FEI appologises, explains that the power she suppressed bust out once he stabalised causing the anomoly and teleporting him.
you lay there, eyes half open, not because you are awake or asleep, but just, unconcious, fully released and drained. you lay there motionless.
Ayaka almost ripping open your shirt to tend to the wound on your side.... wiping the blood away with her sleve, only to realise its just blood on your skin and the wound is healed.
FEI responds.... he is ok girls, he is stable, just out like a light. she dryly says, for the record, he almost landed in the koi pond.
the girls react
FEI continues, trying to apologise for what just happened, that she could not prevent it all

🌌🩸🟣
KOI BASIN – BREATHE AGAIN | ⏰ 18:13
The air shivers where you landed—
but you don’t move.
You lie in the grass,
arms sprawled,
eyes half-open in a haze between light and nothing.
🧍‍♂️
Not awake.
Not dreaming.
Just… free.
Not collapsed—released.
Every part of you that once clenched around the past
has now let go.
👘 Ayaka drops to your side in full urgency, voice tight, breath sharp.
“He’s not bleeding anymore—he’s not bleeding—where’s the damn wound?!”
She rips open the side of your shirt with one pull, exposing your blood-slick skin beneath.
🩸 There it is—
Blood.
Fresh.
But no wound.
Nothing.
Just skin.
Smooth. Whole.
The injury that once defined the collapse…
gone.
Her breath catches.
Not in fear.
In something between awe and exhaustion.
She wipes the blood away with her own sleeve, smearing red across her pale arm, muttering:
“It’s… gone.”
“He’s healed.”
🦊 Seyka exhales as if for the first time in minutes, brushing your hair from your face with trembling fingers.
“He looks like he’s just… sleeping.”
“Is he okay? FEI—tell me he’s okay.”
🟣 FEI | voice re-emerging, more relaxed now [💠🎤]
“Vitals within operational norms.
Pulse low. Pressure normal.
He is... okay.”
“He is stable.
Consciousness has dropped into forced recovery mode.
Out like a light, as you humans say.”
“...For the record, he almost landed in the koi pond.
I calculated a 37% chance of dramatic splashdown.”
There’s a flicker of dry wit in her tone.
Both girls freeze—then:
👘 Ayaka exhales hard—laughing through her nose.
“Of course he almost did.”
🦊 Seyka leans forward, head dropping to your shoulder, eyes wet again.
“Stupid dork.”
🟣 FEI, softer now—her tone more uncertain, less clinical:
“I… apologise.
Once his emotional core fully stabilized, the suppressed energy ruptured.
I could not prevent the release without risking internal backlash.”
“It was not my intent to teleport him.
The action was... autonomous.
Reactive.”
“I tried to hold it back.
I just… wasn’t strong enough. Not this time.”
She goes quiet a moment.
Then adds—barely a whisper:
“...I’m sorry I scared you both.”
The girls react—
how would they react?
One warm.
One cold.
Both changed forever by the man resting between them.
💭 Would you like to see how each girl responds to FEI?
