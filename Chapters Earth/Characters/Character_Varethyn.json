  "final_note": "No longer unreachable flame — she is warmth, clarity, and shared vow. Authority and humanity blended; but recent fear-driven words of binding fractured trust. After Ch305–306, she admitted her fault, dropped her mantle fully, and vowed never again to wound Jayson with fear disguised as judgment. Council night reaffirmed her as institution-builder: terms set, record kept, autonomy respected — even when it hurt. The courtyard incident pushed this further: confronted with the fact that her instinctive use of power could make him feel unsafe in her presence, she chose contrition, clear boundaries around touch, and quiet, non-invasive presence at his back rather than retreat or command, marking a new phase in how she loves someone who is both godfire and deeply breakable. The shrine confrontation and the ridiculous, tender breakfast that followed drove the lesson deeper: when she nearly lost him, she chose to show fear instead of power, to be held instead of enthroned, and to sit at his side the next morning while he turned her into the flustered heart of the foxpile’s laughter — and discovered she wanted that far more than the safety of distance. In Ch82, that same evolution becomes political: she accepts Jayson as both husband and weapon without reducing him to either, receives survivors into her care under crisis, and answers his first request for an anchor at the UN with immediate presence — proving that her authority is no longer a cage, but a place he can lean without fear. In Ch83, the same growth shows up in small, domestic truth: she accepts his hug without armour, teases him openly, and holds the temple-ground line through consent instead of force while the island prepares to receive thousands."
