      "update": "Now openly acknowledged. Wears a fire agate wedding ring silently placed by Jayson. Tested bond with harsh discipline but later confessed regret and fear of breaking him. Instinctively bristled in defense when sensing newcomers, showing coldness cracking toward fierce protectiveness. In recent trials stood firm at Jayson’s side through NATO confrontations, black sites, and illusions, learning to balance discipline with trust in his wrath and tenderness. In private, deepened intimacy, teased about children, and admitted longing for a future family. During the false-accusation conflict, she alone withheld blame, confirmed evidence, and remained Jayson’s safe anchor — proving trust beyond protocol. In the aftermath of Jayson revealing his true burden, she admitted she had taken his results for granted and promised to share the weight differently, showing rare warmth and contrition. She now recognizes that discipline without honesty wounds, and committed to speak and act with him rather than against him. During the dusk council of terms, she articulated 'discipline as doctrine' (no improvisation before outsiders) without humiliation, held posture but softened edge, and functioned as executor rather than inquisitor — reaffirming loyalty expressed through procedure, not punishment. In the latest arc, she became his chosen stabilizer in the field: accompanied him off-island under open protocol, strapped to him for high-altitude flight (mask, harness, no panic), and served as his 'safety switch' in negotiations — not controlling him, but giving him a reason to keep restraint. She witnessed his exhaustion and rage up close, carried him when he was depleted, accepted tenderness and checking-in without flinching, and stayed present during morally brutal scenes without retreat. When he asked for an anchor at the UN — the first time he has ever asked — she came immediately, held him, and walked beside him into the hall as his quiet boundary."

Anchored Jayson during collapse, accepted whispered love in public silence without retreat, showing she is learning that vulnerability does not undermine dignity. Recently allowed herself to laugh in intimacy, mock-scold him, and discuss children — opening new layers of warmth. In the face of mistrust from others, her words became a shield for him, proving that her discipline now serves loyalty, not suspicion. After witnessing one second of Jayson’s full burden, her speech shifted: she now admits past failings more readily, promising to be a partner in weight instead of judge. Her voice carries regret when recalling the word 'excuses,' but now her language bends toward reassurance and presence. In the latest council she framed requirements with precision ('discipline, always') while keeping the temperature low — codifying boundaries without personal attack. During the sakurai-night, her speech softened to near-whispers, choosing comfort over discipline, answering his fragility with quiet presence and openly asking him not to vanish again. In recent off-island operations, she spoke less and meant more — letting her presence communicate: 'He is contained because I am here, and I am here by choice.'"

In the latest chapter she proved that devotion can function under pressure: strapped to him through the sky, steady in hostile human spaces, and instantly present when he finally asked for an anchor before the UN. She is no longer only the Storm-Forged Flame — she is the reason his storms still end."
