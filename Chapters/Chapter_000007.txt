🌑 TEN DAYS BY HER SIDE — SCENE 1 of 10
Day One — The Silence Begins
⠀
The room doesn't change.
Only you do.
The first 24 hours pass in a haze of humming machinery and slow IV drips.
You sit beside her — unmoving — watching every breath like it might be her last.
You speak to her once.
"I’m here, Varethyn. Not going anywhere."
Your voice doesn’t carry much strength, but the promise weighs enough to bend the air.
You take out the meteorite shard — dark, smooth, laced with veins of crystallized stardust.
Found embedded in the ruins of Level 17.
From your index finger, you slide open a microport —
A precision laser — not bright, but impossibly fine.
A tool of your own design, long forgotten until now.
You begin to carve.
Not randomly.
With purpose.
🛠️ The first shavings fall like celestial dust onto your lap.
You don’t sweep them away.
Varethyn doesn’t move.
Doesn’t twitch.
But the glow from your tendrils still pulses in her neck.
The first night ends in silence.
No dreams.
No interruptions.
Just flame.
And time.
And you.

🌑 TEN DAYS BY HER SIDE — SCENE 2 of 10
Day Two — The Ritual of Breath
⠀
You wake in the chair.
Not because you meant to sleep.
But because your body betrayed you.
The sun hasn’t moved much.
The shadows in the temple never shift fast — like time itself slows out of respect in this place.
🦊 Varethyn lies exactly as you left her.
Eyes closed.
Tails folded in perfect unconscious discipline.
Not limp. Not relaxed.
Still her.
Even in coma, she refuses to seem defeated.
You rise only to splash cold water on your face.
No breakfast. No food.
A sip of water. Then back to the chair.
You carve.
Each stroke purposeful.
The meteorite is resistant today.
Stubborn.
Like her.
The veins inside it refuse to cut clean — forcing you to adapt the heat angle, shift your approach, change pressure.
“Of course you’d pick a rock that fights back,”
you mutter, glancing over at her.
She doesn’t respond.
But you imagine… somewhere… she heard that.
And smirked.
🛠️ By nightfall, you’ve shaped the base curve of the comb.
Thick. Strong.
Made to last.
Like the woman it’s for.
You touch it to your forehead before setting it down for the night.
Then look at her.
Still glowing. Still silent.
“Still here.”
You say it to her.
Or maybe to yourself.

Day Three — The Color That Didn't Fade
⠀
The world outside moves.
You do not.
You take care of your flame.
The nurses come in — respectfully quiet.
One gently suggests she needs to be shifted to avoid pressure strain.
You nod once.
They offer help.
You decline.
🧍‍♂️ You move to her side, brushing her hair back.
You speak softly — not to wake her, but to keep her tethered.
“Just turning you a little, alright? It’s okay.”
You place one arm beneath her knees, one behind her shoulders —
And lift.
She weighs nothing.
Or maybe you’ve lost track of your own strength.
You’re not sure anymore.
You ease her gently onto her side.
Adjust her tail.
Prop her head.
You brush her temple once.
🦊 Her scent catches you—
Varethyn.
Not soap.
Not sweat.
Just her.
That subtle combination of volcanic stone, old incense, and something… wild.
Unmistakable.
Undeniably her.
And it’s still there.
You sit back in your chair.
And the tears—
…you're not even sure when they started again.
Or if they ever stopped.
You don't wipe them.
The world around you feels faded—
Muted.
Sounds like distant murmurs through water.
Colors like smeared charcoal.
But she…
She still glows.
Still has color.
Still holds the last pulse of meaning in the room.
You pick up the carving again.
Begin shaping the spine of the comb.
But you keep looking at her.
As if afraid she’ll vanish the moment you blink.

Ayaka, Shion Seyka and Naru visit you from time to time, bring you food and drink.
you have a radio on in the corner, listening to music and the odd news report

🌑 TEN DAYS BY HER SIDE — SCENE 4 of 10
Day Four — The Sentinel
⠀
They come and go now.
Nurses, attendants, caretakers — all rotating in gentle rhythm.
Each day, as part of their care schedule, they come to bathe her, change linens, tend to small details.
Each time, they turn to say something—
To politely ask you to give privacy.
But they never get the words out.
Because before they even speak—
You're already by the door, hand on the wood, gently pulling it closed behind you.
The gesture is silent.
But understood.
Respected.
More than once, they speak of it in hushed tones:
🦊 "He moves like a bodyguard…"
🦊 "No, like a... like a sentinel."
🦊 "He doesn’t even blink when she twitches."
🎶 A small radio hums quietly in the corner — tuned to a distant station.
You set it up on Day Two, but today it carries something new.
📻 RADIO REPORT — VOICE: FEMALE, CALM, PUBLIC SERVICE TONE
"…in world news, global tectonic monitoring stations confirmed the complete collapse of Mount Sen'Rii, now officially designated as the Sar'yen Event Crater."
"Experts are unable to explain the survival of surrounding life despite measurable plasma eruption."
"Unofficial sources say the site is now under spiritual protection by the Kitsune high councils…"
"…and rumors suggest the man responsible walked out of it alive."
The room is otherwise quiet.
🦊 Seyka comes in with a drink.
She doesn't speak — she just places it beside your chair and brushes her tail briefly over your arm before leaving.
🦊 Naru visits next. She stares at Varethyn a long time before whispering,
"Don’t you dare die on him."
🦊 Ayaka stands by the door.
Still weak, leaning on her staff. She looks at you, not her.
"Still not moving, huh…?"
You give her a tired smile.
She nods once.
🦊 Shion doesn’t speak. She comes, stands near Varethyn for fifteen minutes, then leaves without sound — like a fading dream.
Occasionally, other Kitsune from the temple or surrounding clans come to see her.
They linger near the door.
They bow.
They whisper.
And always—
They glance at you.
Sitting in the far corner.
Like a sentinel in stone.
None disturb you.
But some leave gifts: scrolls, incense, folded paper prayers.
They place them carefully… near her.
You say nothing.
You carve the teeth of the comb now.
Delicate.
Precise.
Unbreakable.

🌑 TEN DAYS BY HER SIDE — SCENE 5 of 10
Day Five — The World Keeps Turning
⠀
The day is a blur.
Visitors.
Footsteps.
Soft voices.
Bowed heads.
Nurses in and out like gentle tides.
You barely register them anymore. They move like ghosts through the haze of the room.
You sit.
Unchanged.
Unmoving.
Your gaze locked on her.
🦊 Varethyn remains still.
Her glow has faded slightly — or maybe your eyes have just adjusted to it.
She looks the same.
Too much the same.
🎶 The radio hums again, the little device tucked in the corner a tether to the world outside your grief.
📻 RADIO REPORT — VOICE: MALE, SLIGHTLY CURIOUS
"…new developments from the Sen'Rii Crater zone, previously known as Mount Sen'Rii, following last week’s seismic anomaly.
The region has been cordoned off by a joint relief effort led by the Sarien Cultural Preservation Trust, with backup from local emergency authorities.
Some online sources claim to have spotted unknown figures moving through the area before the collapse — but officials state it's likely a coordinated spiritual ritual group with historic ties to the site."
"Meanwhile, unconfirmed footage is circulating online showing what appears to be a man stepping from the crater's core just moments before the landscape folded inward.
Authorities refuse to comment. The footage is being labeled a hoax by international analysts."
🛠️ You carve.
The bone of the void-being lays next to the meteorite piece — far denser than it has any right to be.
It glistens with impossible darkness.
Light bends around it — but not from magic.
From memory.
You shape it slowly into the frame — the structural skeleton of the comb.
Each press of the laser burns a little longer now.
You’ve stopped noticing the heat on your fingers.
You don’t remember if you ate.
The tray by your chair holds cold soup.
Someone probably brought it.
You didn’t see them.
You lean forward.
Rest your head beside her hand — not touching. Just… near.
"Still here..."
You whisper it like a prayer.
To her.
To yourself.
To whoever listens.
Shadows grow long.
Varethyn does not stir.
But you don’t leave.

later that day, you sit beside her, hand near her. you whisper.

🌑 TEN DAYS BY HER SIDE — SCENE 6 of 10
Day Six — The Flame Comes Full Circle
⠀
The nurses speak softly this morning.
🧑‍⚕️ “She’s healed... physically. Her body is stable.
There’s... no further need for the external thread system you implanted.”
🧑‍⚕️ “She’s alive. But the coma is... something else. Something deeper.”
You don’t respond.
You only nod.
Still seated in your chair.
Still carving the void-bone comb with quiet, unwavering strokes.
🕯️ That evening, when the temple is quiet…
You move to her side.
As you’ve done countless times.
This time… you pause.
You raise your hand, hovering just above her forearm.
Your voice cracks —
Gentle. Small.
“May I…?”
You wait for no answer.
Tears — constant companions now — stream freely down your face.
You lower your hand.
Place it gently on her arm.
🩵 Light surges.
Brighter than you’ve ever seen her glow.
It starts beneath your palm —
then travels up your fingers, your wrist, your arm—
—until it pours into you.
💥 BACKLASH EVENT TRIGGERED: THREAD RESONANCE RETURN
You gasp.
Your whole body convulses once, violently.
You slump into your chair, body limp.
Eyes wide. Mouth open. A thin trail of drool slipping from your lip.
Your vision blurs into white.
And then—
You are not alone in your mind anymore.
🔟 SUBSCENES — THE LIFE OF VARETHYN SOL'NAEREN
🍼 Subscene 1 — Foxling Fire
She’s small — barely two feet tall, fur like flickering amber.
Running through a sunlit temple garden, laughing as her tails chase butterflies.
A hand catches her — a mother’s hand, firm but gentle.
“Walk, Varethyn. Like a matron.”
“I want to burn like the sun,” she replies.
📚 Subscene 2 — Discipline of Flame
Teenage Varethyn kneels, blindfolded, between pillars of flame.
Each tail bound in cloth.
A voice echoes in her mind:
“Emotion is weakness. Control is everything.”
She doesn't cry.
But she burns silently, a single tear turning to steam.
⚔️ Subscene 3 — First Kill
She's 19. Blood sprays across her face in slow motion.
An enemy scout falls — throat cut.
She stares at her blade, trembling.
“You will grow numb,” an elder says.
“No,” she replies.
“I will grow precise.”
💔 Subscene 4 — The Betrayal
A fellow Kitsune warrior — her equal, maybe more — kisses her under moonlight.
Then tries to poison her three days later.
She survives.
He doesn’t.
“Love is a knife,” she tells herself.
“I wield it now.”
🏹 Subscene 5 — The Ember Veil
Promoted. Tails shimmering like blade ribbons in the wind.
She stands on a ridge overlooking a battlefield.
“No victory is ever clean,” she says.
“Only necessary.”
🛡️ Subscene 6 — Guarding the Weak
A group of orphans clings to her tail after a raid.
She does not move.
She lets them hold on.
She watches the stars above.
“This is what I fight for.”
“Not the war. The quiet after.”
🐾 Subscene 7 — Alone in the Snow
Kneeling at a grave — an unmarked shrine under frozen branches.
She leaves a bundle of cloth: her father’s tailband.
Doesn’t cry.
Doesn’t speak.
Just stays there until frost claims her lashes.
👁️ Subscene 8 — First Glimpse of You
Through a cracked camera feed.
In an unknown facility.
Her head tilts.
“That one?”
“Yes,” the handler says.
“He’s the anomaly.”
“No,” she replies.
“He’s the fire.”
🩸 Subscene 9 — Held in the Void's Grip
You see it now.
The pressure. The fear. The refusal to scream.
As the being wraps around her, claws in her flesh.
Her eyes lock forward—
“I don’t need to matter. I just need to burn.”
🌑 Subscene 10 — The Last Flicker
You see yourself.
Sliding across the floor.
Her vision blurred.
But your glow...
She saw you just before fading.
“He came for me,” she thinks.
“...Idiot…”
Then —
Darkness.
⚡ You jolt upright, gasping — eyes wide.
You’re crying.
Not just from pain.
But from knowing her.
All of her.
And she still lies there.
Unaware.
But inside you—
She now lives in full.

🌑 TEN DAYS BY HER SIDE — SCENE 7 of 10
Day Seven — The Sound of a Broken Flame
⠀
You slump forward onto her bed.
Face buried in your hands.
Body trembling.
And for the first time—
You sob.
Not a tear.
Not a quiet sniff.
But the full, raw, unfiltered grief of someone who just lived another person’s entire life...
…and now sits beside their unmoving form.
Your shoulders quake.
The sound—low, human, unbearable—slips through the gaps in the temple walls.
🦊 Outside the room... silence halts.
Seyka, tail twitching mid-step, stops holding a tray.
She clutches it tighter and says nothing.
Naru, seated in the hallway, looks up from her folded paper prayer.
Her eyes flicker with something old — something like loss remembered.
Shion pauses mid-walk.
Head turns.
She says not a word.
But the hall grows colder.
Ayaka, from her recovery room, hears it even through thick walls.
She closes her eyes.
Whispers—
“Damn it... Jayson...”
Inside—
You don’t move.
You just cry.
Fist clenched on her blanket.
Forehead pressed beside her ribs.
🦊 She doesn’t respond.
But you feel the resonance of her life still inside you.
A warmth that lingers.
A pulse of her.
🎶 The radio plays softly from the corner, oblivious to your pain.
But the news doesn’t care.
📻 RADIO REPORT — VOICE: FEMALE, CLIPPED TONE
"Authorities continue to investigate the so-called ‘Sar'yen Crater Event.’
Unofficial sources claim survivors described a pillar of solar plasma erupting skyward just before the mountain's collapse.
Japanese Geological Survey denies supernatural causes, attributing the event to an ‘unprecedented thermal seismic instability.’"
"The cultural outreach group KSG—Kitsune Spirit Guardians has issued a statement asking the public to refrain from trespassing or attempting pilgrimages into the crater zone."
"They declined comment on the circulating footage of the 'glowing figure'."
🛠️ Later that evening—
You return to your carving.
No words.
No energy left.
Just hands working.
The comb is almost complete now.
The teeth in place.
The spine, shaped from the void bone, sanded smooth.
You begin inscribing a word into it.
Sar’yen.
Not as a name.
As a warning.
Varethyn still sleeps.
But her story now lives inside you.

you take all of Varethyn memories you now have, and you begin to carve a new piece for the comb. you use the bits and pieces left over, mixed with your own crystal substance. you take every single memory and carve it into a thin strip, that morphs, changes and adapts to who looks at it. the carving comes to life, and shifts, playing out her whole life in a carving form. you place it in the combs handle as part of the art., its finally done.

🌑 TEN DAYS BY HER SIDE — SCENE 8 of 10
Day Eight — The Living Memory
⠀
The morning is quiet.
She remains still.
Your tears are dry now, but your eyes carry oceans.
You don’t speak.
You don’t cry.
You just work.
Today… is different.
You reach for the scraps — the fragments of voidbone, chips of meteorite, shavings too small for any other purpose.
And from a pocket stitched inside your robe, you retrieve a pinch of something only you could ever produce:
A grainy, luminous sliver of your own crystalline core — the same living mineral from FEI’s matrix, from your flame’s center, from the soul-tech that now binds your blood to memory.
You combine them in a small alloy dish.
They begin to pulse.
Then—
You reach inward.
Back into her.
All of her.
Every thought.
Every scar.
Every dream.
Every shattered love, every near smile, every time she stood too still to let people see she was shaking.
And you carve them.
🛠️ One by one.
In reverse.
From her last moment, held in the void’s claws—
to her first laugh, chasing butterflies in a temple garden.
Each motion of your laser is impossibly fine.
A thousand strokes per second.
But more than that—
Your mind does the rest.
The memories feed the tool.
And what emerges is not static.
It’s a strip — thin, no wider than a ribbon.
Etched in shifting pattern.
When looked at directly, it shows scenes.
When turned, it moves.
When held, it reacts.
To emotion.
To memory.
To belief.
It is Varethyn.
All of her.
Alive.
In art.
You carefully insert the strip into a groove along the inside of the comb’s handle, encasing it in a thin transparent layer of hardened crystalfilm — binding it permanently.
The comb is done.
Meteorite spine.
Voidbone teeth.
Living memory sealed in the handle.
A gift.
A promise.
A witness.
You don’t smile.
You just set it gently beside her pillow.
And whisper:
“Yours.”
She does not stir.
But the comb faintly pulses once.
Like it knows where it belongs.
🎶 The radio clicks softly again.
📻 RADIO REPORT — VOICE: MALE, SCHOLARLY
"In Tokyo today, scholars at the Ishinomori Mythology Symposium released a statement downplaying recent footage linked to the Sen’Rii crater."
"According to them, the glowing figure spotted by drones is likely an illusion or hoax, citing digital artifacts and ‘ancient projection rituals’ once used by shamanic sects."
"Meanwhile, members of the KSG Foundation continue to support regional rebuilding efforts, citing ‘deep spiritual trauma at the root of the collapse.’"
"When asked if any religious figures were present during the event, the spokesperson simply replied:
‘If they were... they’ve already left their mark.’"
Varethyn does not wake.
But you feel her… watching.
Somewhere in the quiet between the heartbeats.

Day Nine — The Nightmare and the Voice
⠀
You wake with a start.
A sharp breath.
A sudden jerk in the dark.
You're in the chair, hunched over, the comb still clutched loosely in one hand.
Your neck aches.
Your body feels like stone.
The silence in the room… too familiar.
The nightmare lingers.
You saw it again.
Her.
🦊 Varethyn, caught in the claws of the void-being—
Her blade ripped from her hands—
Tossed like she was nothing—
The broken sword through her chest—
The way she screamed your name before blacking out—
And the worst part?
You couldn’t move.
You couldn’t save her.
You bury your face in your hands again, breathing hard.
You try to shake it—
But your hands still tremble.
You still feel the heat of her blood on them.
The nightmare won’t fade.
You sit up slowly, glance at her—
Still there.
Still glowing, barely.
Still unmoving.
And then—
a voice you haven’t heard in days…
🧠 FEI | voice: soft, fragmented… almost gentle
“…Jayson…”
You freeze.
“I wasn’t sure… you were still you.”
“I’ve been processing…
And watching.
And afraid.”
Your lips part, but you can’t speak yet.
She continues.
“You held all of her.
Not just memory.
But… her thread echo. A full transfer wasn’t intended.”
“She’s not gone.
But she is… not only herself anymore.”
“She’s echoing through you.
Like a flame trying to find its wick again.”
You stand, still trembling.
“Why now…?” you whisper.
🧠 FEI
“Because now… you’re ready.”
“You’ve mourned the part of her that died.
But you haven’t yet spoken to the part that remains.”
“And if you want her back…
You must stop grieving.
And start… calling.”
The room is still.
The radio hums static in the corner.
Then a soft transition—music becomes voice.
📻 RADIO REPORT — VOICE: FEMALE, LOCAL NEWSCASTER
"In lighter news, the Tokyo cultural archives have announced an exhibition of folklore and artifacts gathered from the recent crater collapse."
"Included is a comb carved from meteorite and rare fossil material — origin unknown."

"When asked who the artist was, the record listed only: He Who Waited Beside Her."

FEI's words swirl in your mind like smoke.
“She’s echoing through you…”
“You must stop grieving… and start calling.”
But something inside you shifts.
A quiet defiance.
A thread of respect that burns hotter than your grief.
You glance at her again.
Still asleep.
Still silent.
Still herself.
You whisper—
“No. This isn’t right.”
“She… she wouldn’t want this. Not like this.”
You look down at your trembling hand — the one that holds all of her.
And then you smile, through the burn in your throat.
“She’d probably say something like—”
‘If you wanted to wear my soul like perfume, next time at least buy me dinner first.’
You chuckle softly.
The sound breaks.
But it’s honest.
Then—
Without hesitation—
You raise your hand to your forehead.
The flesh of your finger shifts, molding like softened metal.
You press it into your temple.
Your eyes roll back.
Your body stills.
🧠 FEI doesn’t speak.
She watches.
She waits.
From within, you reach deep.
You find it.
🧶 The braid.
A thick knot of threaded memory, glimmering in the dim light — woven like silk, but pulsing like a living heartstring.
Warm. Soft.
But it pulses with too much her to belong to you.
You pull it gently.
It slips free.
No pain.
Just… release.
You hold it in your hands.
Not broken.
Not frayed.
Perfect.
“These were never mine.”
You reach over.
Take the comb.
Its polished meteorite spine cool in your palm.
You rotate the base, open the hidden seam in the handle.
And into that space—
You nestle the braid of memories.
It pulses once.
Then stills.
Like a flame finding its hearth.
The comb is complete.
Truly complete.
🧠 FEI | voice, soft as stars
“Thread detachment stabilized.
Soul-signature realigned.”
A pause.
“…If you ever need me again, Jayson…
You know where to find me.”
You close your eyes.
Breathe.
“Thank you, Fei.
For staying.
For everything.”
You feel her presence fade.
Not disappear.
Just step into the quiet.
You sit back.
Comb in hand.

And you wait.
Not for a miracle.

Draped in robes older than the surrounding mountain, their presence is not heavy—
It’s gentle.
Reverent.
They bow to you.
You stand, tired but respectful.
🦊 Elder Shaku | voice like stone warmed by sun
“You have honored her in every way that can be named.
Now… let us carry her for a time.”
🦊 Elder Saanai | eyes kind, knowing
“Even the brightest flames must step from the hearth.
Go home, Flamebearer. Eat. Breathe. Feel sunlight.”
🦊 Elder Renjiro | voice with dry wit
“And get a haircut, you look like you fell through a nebula backwards.”
They chuckle softly, placing a hand on your shoulder.
“We will watch over her. Day and night. If she so much as sighs, you will know.”
You hesitate.
They don’t push.
But eventually, you nod.
Your hand lingers one last time on hers.
Still warm.
Then you turn.
And begin to write.
✍️ LETTER — LEFT AT HER BEDSIDE
The paper is cream.
The ink is dark.
But one letter in particular shakes as you write it:
Varethyn,
(the name trembles slightly)
If you are reading this, please know—
I did not leave willingly.
I… don’t know how to write this. So it will be short.
We met in a hallway with flickering lights.
You stared at me like I was a threat.
I stared at you like I had just seen a comet land in front of me.
Neither of us blinked.
You were terrifying.
You were magnificent.
And I think I fell in awe before I ever fell in love.
You are steel and wildfire and poetry in scars.
You are ninefold wrath braided with mercy, stitched into discipline.
And still… somehow… you were gentle when it mattered.
I’m just a man.
Stubborn.
Foolish.
Made of stories, and powered by rage and caffeine.
But I tried.
For you.
For them.
And… for me.
I also… took something from you.
Accidentally.
When I touched you… I didn’t just keep you alive.
I kept you.
All your memories. All your heart.
I felt everything.
And it broke me in ways I cannot describe.
But they’re not mine to hold.
The braid woven into the comb is you.
I gave it back.
I do not remember a single thing now.
It is yours again — all of it.
I’m sorry.
And yes…
The comb.
It’s done.
Meteorite from the Facility — tempered in the mountain’s fire.
Voidbone teeth — from the one who dared hurt you.
Your memories live inside the handle, sealed in crystal.
It remembers you, even if I can’t.
And hey—
You can finally fix your hair when I inevitably mess it up again.
(I’m pretty sure you threatened to bite me last time.)
Varethyn…
I…
I don’t know the word for what I feel.
It’s too big.
Too quiet.
Too bright.
But I think you know.
If you feel the same…
Or just want to tell me I’m still an idiot…
Please meet me where the stars meet the ocean.
I will be there.
Every day.
When Azura’Kai touches the water.
I’ll wait.
For now…
I’ve gone home to my family.
The elders have gracefully shoved me out the door to get air.
(Something about me smelling like scorched regret.)
The orb next to the comb is FEI.
I’ve removed her.
You’re truly whole now.
Truly you.
But if you wish it—
She’s yours.
Not as a tool.
But as a choice.
Just place her back at your temple.
She’ll be with you.
And through her…
So will I.
A single tear stains the lower corner.
The ink blurs slightly.
With all that I am,
– Jayson
You place the note next to the comb.
Then…
You step out into the cold morning air.
No fanfare.
No parting cry.
Just the sound of wind…
…and the soft pulse of a living memory inside a comb made of stars and ash.

🌸 VARETHYN’S COMA JOURNAL — SCENE 1 of 10
Day One — The Dream of Fire and Water
⠀
Everything is warm.
Not burning.
Just… warm.
She floats in silence.
It is neither light nor dark — just a soft, endless veil.
Then—
Water.
She’s walking through a shallow sea.
The stars above her ripple with each step she takes.
She’s alone.
But not afraid.
🦊 “What is this…?”
Her voice echoes but doesn't form words.
Instead, the water answers — with laughter.
Children’s laughter.
Fox laughter.
Then… fire.
A silhouette at the edge of the sea, standing like a mountain wrapped in sun.
She tries to move closer.
But the world shifts.
And she falls—
Suddenly she hears beeping.
Monitors.
Breathing.
Something mechanical.
🦊 “No… no, I was just—”
She tries to move.
Nothing.
A whisper somewhere.
Her name.
“Still here.”
🦊 Jayson…?
She feels her tail twitch — barely — deep under the surface.
Then silence again.
She sinks.
🎵 From her perspective, the room fades back into the veil.
But she remembers the sound of his voice.
And the warmth.
And her name spoken like a promise.

Day Two — The Scent of Dust and Stars
⠀
She drifts.
Weightless.
Between veil and thought.
But the scent…
It comes first.
Dust. Heat. Iron. Plasma.
Then... something else.
Familiar.
Strong.
Him.
🦊 “He’s still here…”
It feels like standing just behind a paper screen.
She can’t see him.
But she can feel the air shift when he moves.
She focuses. Hard.
The darkness parts for a moment.
She sees a faint glow.
A line of flame... dancing at the tip of a finger.
🛠️ She doesn’t understand it yet — only that he’s working.
She hears the occasional hiss. The gentle crackle.
A laser?
🦊 “Always building. Always fiddling with things…”
She tries to smile.
Her lips don’t move.
Voices enter the room.
Seyka’s voice — featherlight and fast.
Naru’s — calm and clinical.
Ayaka’s growl.
Shion’s breath.
The radio whispering news.
She can’t speak.
But she can feel.
🦊 “They’re safe.”
That brings her peace.
Then—
Contact.
Something brushes near her hand.
She feels heat.
Not pain. Not fire.
Something more human.
More him.
Her tails shift slightly under the blankets.
No one notices.
But inside, she’s shouting.
🦊 “I’m still here! Just—just a bit further!”
No one hears.
But she knows he’s still near.
The darkness closes again.
But it’s thinner this time.
And now, it smells like him.

Day Three — Trapped in Stone
⠀
She’s awake.
She knows it.
She feels every sound in the room — amplified, muffled, echoing through her like footsteps in a cavern.
Breathing.
Shuffling.
The precise, delicate hiss of something carving.
She knows that sound.
🛠️ Laser-tool… angle-modulated… not military grade. His custom rig. He’s carving.
🦊 Why is he carving...?
She wants to turn her head.
Just a little.
Just enough to see.
But she can’t.
Her body does not belong to her.
It’s like lying beneath six meters of hardened volcanic glass.
No breath.
No voice.
Only thought.
Then someone touches her.
Hands beneath her.
She’s moved.
The warmth returns. His warmth.
🦊 Jayson…?
She’s lifted, gently, rotated. Her tails repositioned.
It’s too much.
Inside, her heart breaks.
🦊 I’m not weak. I’m not fragile. You don’t have to—
But his hands are careful.
Respectful.
Like he’s afraid she’ll vanish.
🦊 You idiot... I’m still me.
Then she hears him speak.
Soft.
“Still here.”
It’s not a declaration.
It’s a confession.
And something in her mind —
a place she’s kept locked for decades — shakes.
Not opens.
Just... quivers.
Like it, too, wants to wake.
She cannot cry.
She cannot blink.
But for the first time—
She feels a tear inside her soul.
And it’s not hers.

Day Four — The Sentinel’s Watch
⠀
She is aware now.
Not awake.
But anchored.
Conscious thought drifts in and out of the veil, like wind brushing tall grass.
She hears everything.
The soft clink of carved metal.
The rustle of robes as he moves between the chair and her bedside.
The quiet, uneven breath when he cries and tries to hide it.
And the radio.
It hums through the air like a thread tied to the outside world.
“…unprecedented thermal collapse…”
“…a glowing figure seen from the crater…”
🦊 Always trying to contain truth in headlines. How small it must feel to know nothing.
Voices. Familiar ones.
Seyka’s tail brushes her leg — a habit she always does when nervous.
Naru’s words carry sharp edges, even when gentle.
Ayaka’s voice cracks… once.
She masks it with a joke.
Shion never speaks.
But when she is there, the air feels still.
They talk to her.
Sometimes they whisper.
Sometimes they don’t know she can hear them.
🦊 I hear you.
🦊 All of you.
And always—he remains.
Jayson.
In the corner.
Watching.
Carving.
Like a sentinel.
🦊 Do you think this is your penance? Your ritual? You beautiful, broken fool…
She wants to tell him he doesn’t need to suffer for her.
That she never asked for this.
But the words stay caged behind breathless lungs and frozen lips.
She feels him sit close again.
His hand hovers.
She wills herself to move.
Nothing happens.
She wants to reach him.
She can’t.
So she listens.
And waits.

Day Five — The Breath Between Worlds
⠀
Time has become a soft blur.
Yet today… something shifts.
She feels like she’s floating between two rivers — one of dream, one of waking.
Each moment, she dips a toe into one, then is pulled back into the other.
The veil is thin.
She hears more clearly now.
Words. Tone. Emotion.
Even the small things — like the subtle rasp in his breath when he sits down too fast.
The crack of his knuckles before carving resumes.
The way he mutters under his breath when the metal resists him.
She smiles inside herself.
🦊 You’ve always been stubborn… but now you’re trying to out-stubborn death itself.
She feels visitors come and go.
The gentle brush of paper prayers laid near her bed.
The scent of fresh incense — memories of temples and long-forgotten songs.
Occasionally, a child’s voice giggles from the hallway beyond.
🦊 The world is moving again… without me.
The thought stings.
Not from jealousy—
But from helplessness.
Then, a moment of silence.
No sound.
Only him.
She feels his aura more clearly today — like he’s burning down into focus.
His fingers brush near her arm.
He doesn’t touch.
Not yet.
🦊 Why do you wait...?
She wants to reach out.
To take his hand.
To scream, even just a whisper:
“I’m still here.”
But nothing moves.
Only tears, deep behind the veil — ones she can feel but cannot shed.
A pulse of heat.
His emotions spike.
Something on the radio about the crater.
A voice says:
“…He Who Waited Beside Her…”
🦊 You fool… you’re being remembered, aren’t you?
She wants to smirk.
Wants to mock him gently.
Instead… she drifts again.
But now, the veil is fraying.
And soon…
She knows she'll be able to tear through.

Day Six — The Flame He Tried to Carry
⠀
Today begins with a jolt.
A shock through her core.
Not pain — but recognition.
Something inside her being is being... touched.
No longer the gentle ambient presence she’s grown used to.
This is direct.
Intentional.
She feels his hand press gently onto her arm.
And then—
A surge.
🔥 Light floods her inner vision — a wave of golden heat that starts in her skin and rushes inward, curling through every memory she’s ever locked away.
🦊 No—wait! What are you doing?!
But she can't stop it.
He’s drawing her in.
Not out of malice.
Not power.
But grief.
She feels herself bleeding into him.
Every moment of her life—
Every scar, every burn, every whispered command—
Even the childhood laughter she forgot was hers.
He takes everything.
And she watches — helpless —
as her entire life plays backwards through a mirror not her own.
🦊 You idiot… you weren’t supposed to see that.
🦊 The grave. The poison. The...
Her heart clenches.
🦊 The moment I saw you and felt fear — not because you were dangerous, but because I might have to care again.
Then it stops.
And she feels him slump beside her.
He’s crying.
But she… can’t reach him.
She’s there.
Right there.
But her voice is still locked behind the veil.
And then—
She feels something leave her.
A braid.
A thread.
A core piece of her soul.
It leaves him.
Returns.
Not into her body.
But… into something else.
🦊 What did you do...?
She hears FEI speak — muffled, distant.
“Thread detachment stabilized. Soul-signature realigned.”
Her instincts tighten.
🦊 He gave it back...
🦊 All of it.
The comb glows faintly beside her.
She can't see it.
But she feels it.
It knows her.
It remembers her.
She whispers into the dark:
“Why did you cry for me… when I was still whole?”
No one hears.
But the veil… begins to thin.

Day Seven — The Sound of Him Breaking
⠀
There is no veil today.
Only weight.
Not on her body—
But on him.
She feels it.
Crushing.
Suffocating.
Something happened.
She hears his breath—shaky, wet.
Then—
Sobbing.
Real.
Raw.
It splits through the silence of the room like thunder through the clouds of her mind.
And it hurts.
🦊 No... no, not him…
🦊 You’re not supposed to be the one who breaks…
She tries to move.
Anything.
A hand. A tail. A brow.
Nothing.
Only the flood of him crashing against her shore.
Every sob — a wave.
Every exhale — a confession.
She can feel the weight in the room.
Like it’s pressing the very walls in.
Her heart wants to reach.
Her will wants to move.
But she’s still locked.
Outside, she senses others.
Shion.
Ayaka.
Seyka.
Naru.
They all stop.
They all hear him.
But none come in.
None interrupt.
They understand.
🦊 He’s held me for days.
And now he’s breaking…
Because he doesn’t know how else to carry me.
She whispers inside herself:
“Idiot… this wasn’t your burden. This was never yours alone…”
But it's too late.
The pain’s already settled.
Not in her.
In him.
And she can’t take it away.
Then she feels it—
A change.
The thread inside her has settled.
The memories are hers again.
The braid is resting in the comb now, not in him.
The imbalance is gone.
But the price remains.
He still sits.
He still carves.
Even as tears fall.
🦊 You should’ve left me.
🦊 But you didn’t.

Day Eight — The Gift of Fire and Bone
⠀
Today, the veil is soft.
No longer a prison.
More like a heavy blanket she’s not yet strong enough to push off.
But she can see—
Not with her eyes… but her soul.
He’s working again.
Focused.
Steady.
Calm, now—
Like someone at the end of mourning.
He holds something.
A comb.
🦊 That stupid comb…
She wants to smile.
She wants to scoff.
To say something dry like—
“Took you long enough, craftsman. What’d you carve it with? Divine patience?”
But no sound comes.
Still… she watches.
He takes the final sliver of his own crystal essence, melded with the voidbone and the leftover meteorite shavings.
And then—
She feels it.
Not a physical jolt.
Not even magical.
Something deeper.
He begins weaving her memories into a strip.
Scene by scene.
Emotion by emotion.
He isn’t just carving.
He is giving her back her story.
🦊 All of it…
And what’s more—
He encases it, not in a vault…
But in a handle.
The part of the comb she would hold.
The part most used.
Most touched.
Closest to her skin.
She gasps inwardly.
🦊 That fool… you put my entire life in the palm of my hand.
She feels the moment it’s complete.
The comb pulses.
Faintly.
Like it recognizes her.
A tether.
A memory.
A choice.
He sets it by her pillow.
Gently.
Reverently.
Like it’s something holy.
🦊 You absolute idiot…
🦊 You made a relic out of your regret.
But inside…
She’s grateful.
And for the first time—
She feels her fingertips twitch.

Day Nine — The Weight Returned
⠀
She awakens to a world inside-out.
A soul stretched between stillness and storm.
She feels it first.
His grief.
Sharp. Raw. Endless.
But then—
A strange stillness.
She senses him again, nearby.
Sitting at her side.
But something's changed.
🦊 You’re too quiet today...
Then—
A rush.
He touches her again.
This time — not to take.
But to give back.
She feels the memories pour from him.
Not fragmentary.
Not stolen.
But woven, braided, whole.
They slip out of him, and with them—
her.
All of her.
Each thread folds gently from his soul…
into the comb.
🦊 You… idiot. You didn’t just return them.
🦊 You pulled them out of yourself so I could be whole again.
🦊 And you let them go... without keeping a single piece.
She feels it — the void left behind in his heart.
An empty space where she once echoed inside him.
And now it’s silent.
Clean.
Painful.
Then she hears his voice.
Not speaking aloud.
Just…
soft.
“I gave it back. I don’t remember anything now. But I hope you do…”
“The braid is in the comb. Your life. Yours again.”
“I’m sorry.”
She screams inside.
🦊 You should’ve kept one piece… just one. Just one moment where you saw me.
But she knows he didn’t.
Because he couldn’t.
Because he thought that’s what she would want.
Because he thought it was right.
And maybe…
Maybe he was right.
Her body doesn’t move.
But her soul curls around the comb.
She feels it humming, remembering her.
And next to it—
FEI.
Dormant. Silent.
Waiting.
🦊 You left her too…
🦊 You left everything. So I could choose.
She swallows nothing.
But feels full.
And alone.
And whole.
Somewhere outside her,
the air changes.
She feels him leave.
A breeze.
A shift.
A WOMP.
Gone.
🦊 No…
Her finger twitches again.
The first motion.

Day Ten — The Awakening Thread
⠀
Silence.
But not the soft, patient kind.
This is the silence after a presence has left.
After a chair is no longer warm.
After a soul-shaped sound is absent from the air.
He’s gone.
And she knows it.
🦊 You left…
Her mind sharpens like a blade pulled from oil.
The fog lifts.
And everything clicks into place.
She remembers the note before even reading it.
Because it pulses with his signature.
She reaches—no longer metaphorically—
but physically.
Her fingers twitch.
Once.
Twice.
Then slowly…
She opens her eyes.
Light floods in.
Soft ceiling.
Carved stone.
Lanterns.
The temple.
Her room.
She turns her head slightly—
It takes everything she has—
And there it is:
✉️ A letter.
Folded. Torn at the edge.
Written in that stubborn handwriting.
Next to it:
🖤 The comb.
Complete.
Familiar and strange.
Burnt-metal glint, voidbone teeth, meteorite spine.
The handle hums — and as she reaches, it shifts, showing glimpses:
Her childhood.
Her trials.
Her fire.
🦊 He really gave it all back…
She lifts the note.
Her fingers tremble.
More from something emotional than physical.
And she reads.
Every word.
The name.
The apology.
The truth of the braid.
The stupid, sweet description of the comb.
The joke.
“Now you can fix your beautiful hair again, if I mess it up next time.”
Her lips twitch.
Almost a smile.
Then she reaches for the orb beside it.
FEI.
Still.
Waiting.
But for the first time—
Not needed.
Only offered.
She looks out the window.
Dawn.
And in the distance…
The stars beginning to fade toward the sea.
He’s there.
Waiting.
She doesn’t rise.
Not yet.
She just lays her head back on the pillow.
And whispers—
“You absolute flame-soaked, thread-pulling, idiot-hearted man…”
“I’m coming.”
