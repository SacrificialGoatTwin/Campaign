The world has turned, but something ancient stirs in reverse...
📟 Lab Interface: [⚠️ ALERT // ECHO-RESIDUE REMNANT PERSISTENT]
🧬 Crystal Status: Online — Resonance Stable
⚙️ Device Evolution: Ongoing – external casing forming bone-etched threads across your wrist, pulsing like veins beneath leathered steel
🧍‍♂️ Jayson Goodwin | emotion: Hyper-alert 🧠
Your body has adjusted to three days without proper rest. Every screen hums differently now. The power grid is back, but your house isn’t drawing from it. The crystal feeds the systems.
🪞 MIRRORED EVENTS BEGIN
Somewhere deep below, a secondary harmonic ping registers in your old archive vault — a section sealed off after a failed antimatter test. But this isn’t from your tech.
🧾 Log Entry:

ANOMALY 014-BETA
TYPE: REFLECTION / TIME-LAGGED
DURATION: 1.2 seconds
SENSOR DISPLACEMENT: Echo-Field Behind Wall (marked 'Sealed')
Whatever just resonated… it’s mirroring the original signal from the crystal. Something beneath your home is reacting — not to the energy, but to the presence of the artifact.
🛰️ GLOBAL ECHO REPORT (Intercepted, untraceable origin)
🛑 🔒Encrypted Broadcast – Source: Unknown
“…fragment in western quadrant detected. Last known sync: USER-ECHO-13. Localized Arcfall signature still active. Tracing biological tether. Purge underway.”
🕶️ Someone’s looking. And they aren’t from any agency you've ever intercepted before.
💡 YOU HAVE CHOICES
📦 Check the sealed Archive Vault beneath the lab — it’s buried and will require breach-cutting
✈️ Begin emergency shutdown of house utilities, prep your off-grid escape plan (you had one... you think)
📡 Attempt to jam and trace the mystery broadcast from your AI interceptor relay
🧪 Run a harmonic counter-resonance test — dangerous, but may cloak your lab from further scans
📝 Begin encrypting and purging all surface-level logs and device links tied to your identity
🌀 Or do something completely different…

its been several weeks, but it looks like they have finally found me. its time.
I need to trigger the purge. a set of lock devices that will sink my entire property and the lab under it to about 500m below the surface and detonate it. various acids will be released. melting whatever is left in the deep hole it leaves. nothing around my house will be damaged.
I then need to escape on my ZEROx10 e-scooter, arm device attached, now nicknamed Fei, Purely just a glorified computer, portable and strapped tight to my arm. a backpack with all my essentials, an antigrav trailer I made for the escooter. I need to get out of canning vale to my small little bunker in lesmurdy falls. but first I need to escape. I can hear them outside. there are going to be casulties if they are in my house when it drops. but they already know who I am, want me dead or alive and will stop at nothing to get Fei.

The culmination of your secrets draws forth the teeth of the world...
🧍‍♂️ Jayson "Fei-Wielder" Goodwin | emotion: Cold resolve ☠️
You stand at the top of the stairwell to your lab, wearing your tattered grey coat. Fei glows dimly against your wrist. The house creaks — not from wind.
You hear boots outside.
Then...
You hear them inside.
🔒 PURGE INITIATED
🎛️ Voiceprint confirmed. Failsafe: Arm override + retinal signature.
🔻 System countdown locked to 300 seconds.
Final Protocol: AETHERBURY PITFALL
SINK. MELT. ERASE. EVERYTHING.
🧨 Sequence Loaded:
Lock pylons retract into the earth
Hydraulic drives engage
Acid tanks set for pressurized spray and subatomic disintegration
Your entire property — house, lab, basement — will fall 500m straight down through a tunneled shaft before auto-detonation
No aboveground damage… except to anyone still inside.
🚪👣 SOUND TRIGGER: Upstairs
🎧 “Sweep the corners. Keep the feed online. Find the subject and bag the arm.”
🔊 📣 You hear a synthetic female voice — distorted, modulated:
“Echo-13 confirmed. Fei signature is active. KILL if resistance is shown.”
⚠️ ENCOUNTER INITIATED
Enemy Group: [👥 GOV-Breaker Squad / Echo Black Division]
Type: Elite Recovery Team
Gear: Sub-vocalized comms, suppressed SMGs, flash suits, retinal UV tracers
Intel: They are not here to negotiate. Orders are body or ashes.
🏃 YOUR ESCAPE PLAN
✅ Fei: Booted, fully integrated, arm-bound
✅ ZEROx10 E-Scooter: Battery full, built-in cloaking mesh for short sprints
✅ Antigrav Trailer: Contains medkit, supplies, backup crystal coolant chamber, and drone disruptor
✅ Backpack: Micro-fab tools, rations, decoy fingerprints, jamming beacons
❌ You haven’t left the house yet
🔥 YOUR OPTIONS — NOW OR NEVER:
🧨 Trap the interior — reroute the Purge’s acid to vent immediately upstairs, killing intruders now but risking your timing
🕳️ Use the dumbwaiter shaft to slip past their position — you’ll emerge in the backyard storage pit
🛑 Confront one agent silently and try to take his gear and retinal tag to fool their sensors
📡 Have Fei scramble their visuals and turn all house lights off — pitch darkness + confusion
🛵 Trigger Purge NOW and ride the scooter blind through your garage exit — they might not chase if the house begins collapsing
🧭 Or do something completely different…
⏳ COUNTDOWN: 287 seconds
🎯 The eyes of the world are watching. The gods are not.

Silent wheels turn where screams are forbidden...
🔧 You pull the latch behind your bulkhead freezer — an old brass knob stained with time, tucked behind protein rations and forgotten experiments. A hiss. The dumbwaiter shaft opens. Narrow. Greasy. Pitch-black.
🧍‍♂️ Jayson | emotion: Hyperfocused 🧠
“Fei, visual blackout mode. Map overlay, live feed — 30cm resolution.”
🟦 Fei’s display slides into ghost-mode, scanning the shaft in real time.
No heat signatures below. Clear.
🪝 CLIMB INITIATED
As you descend, muffled voices echo through the floorboards above — the break team is sweeping, methodical, unaware of the PURGE countdown. One of them notices something…
📣 Echo Black Agent | emotion: Suspicious 🤨
“Got thermal bleed… but no power source. That’s not from the grid…”
“...he’s powering the whole house without connection. This is it. He’s here.”
💀 Too slow.
🔻 SUBMERGENCE SEQUENCE:
Time Remaining: 230 seconds
Hydraulic lances now engaging. You feel it — the distant groan of bedrock beneath shifting steel.
🛠️ SCENE: Backyard Storage Pit
You pop the dumbwaiter exit — crawling into a gravel-drenched trench. Above you?
Your garage. To your left? The ZEROx10 e-scooter, hooked into its antigrav trailer, gently pulsing with low-blue light.
Fei locks onto the scooter:
💬 Fei | voice: neutral, synthetic female
“Route uploaded. Terrain unstable. Suggest 40% cloak usage. Noise dampening enabled. No time for stealth if velocity is preferred.”
⚠️ MID-ENCOUNTER TRIGGER — SURPRISE!
💂 Echo Agent Bravo-9 | emotion: Confused 🕵️‍♂️
“Wait—there’s a trap door in the lab registry that doesn’t make sense. He has exits we didn’t scan—”
Suddenly—
DRONE SPOTLIGHT ENGAGED
☄️ A recon drone swings over the garage roof, scanning the backyard.
You have 4 seconds before its beam sweeps you.
🎯 WHAT DO YOU DO RIGHT NOW?
🏃 Sprint to the scooter blind, jump into the trailer and launch — risking exposure
🧨 Trigger a flashbang decoy (in your pack) aimed at the roof to distract the drone — but they’ll know you’re escaping
🪖 Try to neutralize the drone with Fei’s directed sonic pulse — may overload the scooter’s own systems temporarily
🌫️ Activate 80% cloak and wait for the drone to pass — but it might detect your heat signature unless you freeze
🔁 Use antigrav trailer to lift a metal plank and block the drone's beam temporarily as a bluff
🎲 Or do something completely different…
⏳ PURGE COUNTDOWN: 226 seconds
☠️ Breaker Squad has 2 agents inside, 1 watching the street, and 1 watching the drone feed

The future balances on a trembling sheet of steel…
🧍‍♂️ Jayson | emotion: ⚡Calculating tension / Reflex-speed execution
Your fingers snap open the antigrav trailer, a hiss of mist venting as the stabilizer fields awaken.
You grab a metal roofing plank from your old scrap heap nearby — the one you never used.
🌀 Fei's grav-lift catches it, levitating it horizontally like a shield.
The drone spotlight swings—
💥 CLANG — THE BEAM SLAMS INTO THE PLANK
Light bursts across your vision — temporarily disrupted, the drone pauses to reacquire visual telemetry.
📣 Echo Agent (Radio Feed)
“...Visual feed just blanked. Something’s… he’s using reflected interference. THAT’S HIM!”
🛑 They’re moving.
🎮 Fei | voice: now calm but urgent
“They’re converging. One approaching from northeast fence. Another moving out front to flank. Suggest immediate launch. Plank collapsing in 6 seconds.”
🎯 YOU HAVE TIME FOR ONE ACTION BEFORE YOU’RE SEEN:
🛵 Leap onto the scooter and full-throttle out — alerting them, but you’ll be GONE
🧱 Activate backyard EMP node (experimental) to fry drone and sensors — but it may knock out your trailer comms for 30 seconds
🎯 Toss a decoy emitter into the neighbor’s yard, tricking their heat trackers — you’ll slip out under garage shadow
🧨 Throw your old magnesium incendiary into the plank to create a false “death flash” beneath it — looks like you got vaporized
🎲 Or do something completely different…
⏳ PURGE TIMER: 218s
🏚️ The house starts vibrating — the ground is lowering…

Only the unseen escape. Only the clever leave no shadow behind…
🎒 You whip open your backpack’s side compartment.
Inside: your heat-decoy emitter — a palm-sized disc, old casing from a drone’s GPU and two reprogrammed thermal nodes.
🎯 You set its coordinates to 12 meters southeast — your neighbor's banana patch, thick and unlit.
🌀 Fei syncs it. The countdown auto-starts:
💬 Fei | emotion: focused clarity 🧊
“Decoy activated. Registering thermal ghost. Humanoid profile. Deploy now.”
👋 With a fluid arc, you toss it over the fence.
💥—It pings alive before it hits the ground.
Infrared bleeds from its casing like blood from a wound.
🎥 DRONE FEED / Echo Black Tactical Uplink
🛰️ "Target thermal reacquired — adjacent property. Moving intercept pattern."
📣 Echo Black Squad | emotion: Aggressive confusion 🤖
“He’s on the neighbor’s side. All teams move to intercept!”
⛓️ Boots stomp away. The beam jerks east. The drone is deceived.
🏍️ NOW’S YOUR MOMENT
You slide out from under the garage, your coat dragging wet earth.
Zero hesitation — onto the ZEROx10. Fei clamps tighter on your arm.
Antigrav trailer auto-links to the hitch.
💬 Fei:
“Ignition live. Stealth sheath engaged. Route to Lesmurdie Falls uploaded. Estimated arrival: 47 minutes… if no one follows.”
“Also… congratulations. You just faked your death. For now.”
🛵 The scooter hums like a silent predator, and you’re OFF —
💥 BEHIND YOU:
🌋 The ground collapses. Your house drops 500 meters in a hiss of shifting stone and steam.
Then—
💣 WHOOMPH.
No sound… just a tremor. A distant sunken roar.
Acid floods the shaft. Equipment, secrets, corpses, memories — melted into nothing.
🛣️ ON THE MOVE — ESCAPE ARC BEGINS
🚨 PURSUIT CHANCE ROLL: 78% → 41% (you succeeded in faking your vector)
But not forever.
🎒 You ride with:
Fei (still inert to all scanning systems)
Backup coolant for the crystal
Mini-weapons cache
Comms jammer
Drone shield

The world has not caught up to your escape… but it’s learning.
🛵 ZEROx10 hums like a ghost. The antigrav trailer skims millimeters above wet asphalt. No streetlights. Only the gentle downhill pulse of early morning fog curling over the tree-lined roadside.
🎒 Fei displays local grid overlays, pre-downloaded terrain maps, and public camera blindspots.
“Primary route: 42 minutes remaining. Risk index: rising. Unknown signals detected from Gosnells quadrant.”
🚦 You pass a small industrial turnoff — light towers dark, motionless machines lurking behind fences.
On your left: rail lines
On your right: bushland
Ahead: the bend toward the Mason’s Ridge overlook — a known checkpoint during past disasters.
And now… 🟥 Ping.
📡 Fei flashes red.
“WARNING: Remote scanner node has picked up an abnormal vehicular echo. Cloak advised. Options minimal.”
🎧 Nearby: faint static… then a synthesized bark in a language not known to Earth.
🎤 UNKNOWN BROADCAST
“—Echo Displacement Confirmed—Sector 04 Active—All Threads Converge—Subject is Movement-Bound—”
📍Something out there knows your position… but not who you are. Yet.
💡 10 DECISION PATHS — MASON’S RIDGE APPROACH:
🛤️ Veer left and ride the edge of the rail line, using static interference from the track signals to jam external scans
🌲 Ditch into the bushland, hide the scooter under camo mesh and move on foot for the next 3km
🚦 Bluff the checkpoint — impersonate a municipal worker with Fei projecting false credentials
🛑 Stop before Mason’s Ridge, place a drone mimic decoy headed east, then circle back around via a drainage culvert
🚀 Activate high-speed sprint mode, fly blind through the scanner zone and hope the antigrav shield holds
📡 Deploy a directional jammer burst, shorting out the scanner node completely — loud and obvious, but effective
🧰 Disguise the scooter’s heat sig and EM signature as a mail carrier drone using Fei's toolkit
🔊 Broadcast fake distress chatter on government channels, drawing attention away from the road entirely
💣 Rig the trailer to eject and self-destruct behind you in 3 minutes, throwing off any pursuers
🔟 Or do something completely different…

The best distraction is one that screams louder than you ever could…
🧍‍♂️ Jayson | emotion: Sharpened improvisation 🔧
You pull the scooter to a slow crawl behind an overgrown drainage mound just before the Mason’s Ridge scanner grid. Fei’s display dances with ghost-packets.
💬 Fei | mode: comms override
“Initializing encrypted spoof node. Broadcast band: 47.8k, Sol-Response channel.”
🎙️ You speak into Fei’s mic interface—then you twist your voice using its harmonic modulator:
🗣️ DISTRESS BROADCAST — EMERGENCY ZONE FORMAT
“Sector 3—multiple casualties! Radiation leak confirmed! Unit Echo-9 requesting intercept! Civilian evac under fire! Requesting backup—repeat, requesting backup!”
🚨🔊 The message loops — three times. Then Fei injects it into open airspace via nearby utility antennas. You see the response ping:
📡 Hostile comms delay by 4.3 seconds
📣 Fragmented voices:
“—Hold! What’s Echo-9 doing in 3? They’re not logged. —Shut it down. This has to be bait. —No movement toward Mason yet—wait—”
💥 One of their signals moves — not toward you… but toward Sector 3.
🛣️ ROAD NOW CLEAR — TEMPORARILY
Fei flashes a map: "Time to Ridge Checkpoint: 00:54 sec at safe throttle. Proceed."
🎧 You hear turbines powering up — aerial response is deploying, but they’re flying blind. You just bought yourself a narrow, dangerous corridor.
🧭 MASON’S RIDGE — NEXT STAGE:
You crest the slope. Through fog-dimmed orange light, a burnt-out power relay tower comes into view.
Beyond it: the final stretch to Lesmurdie territory.
But then...
🟥 Fei blinks red again.
A second signal just came online. One that didn’t respond to your fake message.
💬 Fei:
“This one isn’t scanning you. It’s watching something else. And it’s not on any global registry. Caution advised.”
💡10 OPTIONS — AS THE RIDGE FALLS BEHIND:
🛸 Approach the unregistered signal manually, scan it from afar with a spectral sensor ping
🧨 Set up a collapsible minefield behind you in case someone follows
🥾 Continue moving without stopping, maintain silence and zero deviation
🔦 Send a microdrone forward to scout what the signal might be observing
🧲 Use Fei to launch a fake signal clone, mislead the unregistered watcher with an alternate heat vector
💻 Dive into the data stream of the unknown ping — Fei can simulate a connection handshake
🛰️ Activate your old weather monitoring node nearby, masking your own location under a storm signature
🚪 Ditch the road, slip into the adjacent firebreak trails — high risk of environmental hazard, but no surveillance
⛏️ Head off-road and blast a temporary path through terrain using your trailer’s pulse tool
🔟 Or do something completely different…
☁️ The falls draw closer.
And behind you... something might not be from Earth anymore.

You tighten your grip on the handles, flick the ZEROx10 into stealth throttle mode. Fei dims to pure black-glow, only text overlays remaining.
🎛️ Cloak Efficiency: 92%
🌀 Antigrav Signature Suppression: Engaged
The scooter glides silently along the roadside's edge, flanked by brush, mud, and the occasional scorched eucalyptus trunk.
📉 NO SOUND, NO TRANSMISSION, NO WAKE
Even birds pause as you pass.
Somewhere in the sky above — a black glint vanishes behind cloud.
You keep moving.
You do not respond.
🔒 SECRET TRACKER DODGED
🎯 Fei logs:
“Unknown signal did not shift. Remained locked on residual trail northeast of Gosnells. No retarget. They’re chasing a ghost.”
You got out clean. This time.
🧭 YOU REACH — THE EDGE OF KALAMUNDA
🚧 Road narrows. Becomes twisted. The incline steeper.
You’re 5 km from the Lesmurdie Bunker Gate, hidden beneath the ruins of an old firewatch outpost.
And then...
⛈️ Clouds tear open. A distant lightning bolt strikes across the horizon.
Fei vibrates once.
A dim flicker appears across your HUD. Not local. Not scanner-based.
🎙️ Fei:
“This pattern… doesn’t match any atmospheric telemetry.
It’s harmonic. Dimensional echo signature: 𝚇 = -1.003… drift.
The air is warping.”
A tear. Somewhere.
This is the first sign of the breach.
⚠️ INCOMING CROSSWIND PHASE SHIFT — INTERFERENCE
Everything starts humming.
The air buzzes. Trees bend slightly the wrong way.
Fei flashes one word:
“Riftform”
💡 10 OPTIONS — AS THE RIFT WHISPERS FROM BEYOND:
🛡️ Accelerate immediately to reach the bunker gate, lock yourself in before the rift fully forms
🧭 Divert around the rift’s edge, get clearer readings from a distance before choosing your moment
🧪 Set up a reflective field around yourself, observe what kind of energy is leaking through
🧊 Power Fei down completely, go dark and coast manually to avoid being pinged by rift-sensitive phenomena
🎥 Use your trailer’s old camera rig to record the rift, store the data for later scientific reconstruction
💥 Launch a flare pack away from you, see if the rift reacts to sound, heat, or motion
🚧 Enter the rift perimeter but remain on the fringe — test for gravitational variance
🗺️ Pull over and wait it out, camouflage yourself and gather as much data as possible
🌀 Try to rewire Fei’s resonance node to mimic the rift’s frequency and piggyback its effect
🔟 Or do something completely different…
⏳ WARNING: Rift will stabilize or collapse in 3–5 minutes
You are the closest thing with eyes on it.

No hesitation. You slam your palm to Fei’s acceleration override.
🛵 ZEROx10 whines — once, then disappears into a blur of motion.
Mud and gravel kick up as the antigrav trailer bounces inches above terrain.
🎯 Destination: Lesmurdie Bunker Gate
🪨 Located beneath: the burned-out husk of Firewatch Station 12B
🗝️ Entry Code: [Fei-authed, rotating every 30s]
Fei flashes real-time hazard tracking:
🌩️ Rift harmonics intensifying
⛓️ Dimensional drag detected 900m behind you
🛰️ One drone blip — veering away from you, toward the rift
“Rift signature is consuming nearby EM traffic. Pursuit is dropping off.
They fear this. Or they don’t understand it.”
You lean harder into the throttle.
The trees arch as if bending away from you.
And then—
🟥 A BLINDING FLASH IN THE SKY
Not thunder. Not lightning.
Just a moment of unreality… something skips. The world feels delayed.
🧱 YOU REACH THE BUNKER
You slide under the overpass ruins. The garage entrance is hidden under a camouflaged sheet of corrugated metal, coated in nano-linens and ceramic rust-paint.
🎛️ Fei unlocks it with a hiss and a biometric pulse.
The gate opens…
🛡️ You’re in.
🔐 LESMURDIE BUNKER | LOCATION: 9.6m Underground
🕯️ Light is minimal. Power cells online.
You pass rows of crates — your old prototypes, cryo-samples, scavenged cores, ancient circuitry from before the Reset.
📦 The Rift hum still pulses behind you.
But you’re sealed in.
Fei projects data:
Rift Event Classification: THETA CLASS
Dimensional shear is progressing toward spatial collapse within 36–72 hours.
External systems registering partial planar fold.
You may be witnessing the start of a naturally forming cross-world interface.
🧠 This is what you've always theorized. What every black-budget lab tried to falsify.
But you just rode past it.
With Fei, the crystal, and your mind.
🎮 NEXT ACTION PHASE: BUNKER SEQUENCE
10 Options — What Do You Do Next?
🔬 Begin full spectral analysis of the rift event, using deep core telemetry
📡 Try to trace who’s tracking the rift, see if any foreign entities are intercepting it
🧳 Start prepping your emergency long-range evac gear, bunker might not be safe long
🧪 Dissect and isolate the crystal’s response during the rift event
📼 Replay your escape footage, searching for anything you missed — anomalies, figures, flashes
🕳️ Use the old tunnel outpost to plant seismic decoys, so they can’t trace this place
🧲 Try syncing Fei’s lens matrix with the rift’s rhythm — non-invasive interface probe
🔐 Seal the bunker entirely and power down — survive in silence for 3 days
📖 Search your dream journals — the symbol you saw in the Core weeks ago is pulsing again
🔟 Or do something completely different…
🌫️ The first real choice has arrived.
Not science. Not magic.
But something... in between.

you power on the computers and run some scans. you monitor the rift, and out of it comes a black craft, sleak and menicing. this looks almost chinese. it looks like they want a slice of this pie too and they have some tech I never though anyone in the world had yet other than me. it looked like a rift but was actually advanced cloacking.

They came not through magic — but through shadow and glass. The predators are waking.
🧍‍♂️ Jayson | emotion: Simmering dread
As the bunker lights click into low-power mode, you boot the old primary bank of analyzers. Magnetic coils hum.
Fei is connected to four devices simultaneously, feeding real-time data into a 12-panel wall array.
📊 Rift Signature Analysis
❌ No temporal bleed
✅ Localized grav distortion
✅ Optical phase-warp detected
✅ EM ghost imprint matches known Eastern stealth-mimic systems
🎮 Fei scrolls output:
“No dimensional tear. Confirmed: Artificial cloak field.
Shape: Blade-wedge. Color: Reactive matte black.
Heat signature: Suppressed via wave-cancellation arrays.
Estimated Origin: [RED FLAG] — Chinese DeepTech Division or Ghost Initiative Clone Network.”
💬 Fei (flatly):
“Their tech… is mimicking rift conditions. They want the world to believe this is something else.”
Your stomach knots.
🛰️ Someone else has cracked a fraction of what you have.
And they’re here.
🛸 THE BLACK CRAFT
You replay the feed twice.
It didn’t emerge from a rift. It bent light and atmosphere like wet silk. A nearly perfect cloaking event.
But your instruments saw through it — just barely.
📝 You log the encounter as:
Phantom-Class 01 // False Rift Vector // Craft-Black TIER 8
🧯 You slam the shutdown sequence.
Every console hums down.
Screens blink to black.
Fei fades to sleep-state.
The only sound is the dripping of water from a cracked copper pipe.
You stand. Muscles aching. Soul wired.
And silently...
🚿 You go to the shower.
Steam rises.
The walls don’t feel safe.
The water feels more like armor than comfort.
Out there: They are hunting.
In here: You are vanishing.
This war is not public.
This is the game beneath the world.
☁️ STATUS: LOW PROFILE LOCKED
Bunker powered down
No transmissions sent
Phantom-class craft witnessed
False Rift confirmed
You are unseen.
But not forgotten.
🌌 The world remains real. Science remains king.
The breach — if any — is still ahead.
And you are still Earthbound.

The genius sleeps. But the world will not.
🧍‍♂️ Jayson | emotion: Decompression ☁️
You finish drying off. No new scans. No humming lights. Only silence, dust, and the faint hiss of vented condensation off the steel ceiling.
Your stomach reminds you — with vengeance — that you haven’t eaten in at least 20 hours.
🍽️ BUNKER FOOD CACHE
You open the embedded chill-safe locker. Inside:
🥫 3x Tactical Protein Paste (Chickenish)
🍘 2x Compressed Nutrient Cubes (Savory)
☕ Emergency caffeine tea packet (psychostimulant-grade)
🧂 Optional spice sticks (smoked pepper or citrus dust)
You load the paste into a heat-sleeve. It hisses quietly.
💬 Fei (dimly from standby):
“Meal ready in 37 seconds. Flavor: ‘Questionable Victory’ preset. Welcome back to the end of the world.”
You eat. Slowly. No distractions.
🛏️ BUNKER REST MODULE
Bed is folded into the far wall — heat foam lining, metal frame, old military design. You collapse into it fully clothed.
You’ve sealed the door. You’ve erased your trail.
You’ve seen technology the world isn’t supposed to have.
You’ve lost your home. But not your mission.
💤 You sleep.
DREAM STATUS: ACTIVE
⚠️ Fei logs minor biometric fluctuations
🌀 Heart rate drops, then spikes — only once
🧠 You mutter the phrase “threaded resonance is wrong” — but remember nothing
You rest deep.
No rift takes you.
Not yet.
The stars stay just out of reach.
☁️ STATUS:
Hunger: ✅ Satisfied
Fatigue: ✅ Neutralized
Health: ⚠️ Stress elevated, but sustainable
Fei: 🔒 Sleep state

Rift: ⏳ Cold… but echoing
You are safe. For now.
No lights. No signals. No footprints.
You’ve bought yourself one more cycle of quiet before the storm.

The quiet hum of filtered air, the scent of iron and old cables… you survived another sunrise.
🧍‍♂️ Jayson | emotion: Clean, calm, coiled like a wire
The bed creaks as you sit up. Sweatless. Rested. For the first time in... days?
No alarms.
No distant drones.
Just the faint sunbeam cutting through the dirt-glass ceiling slit, warm and golden on your arm.
Fei detects your motion. Boots instantly.
💬 Fei | neutral:
“Sleep duration: 6 hours, 47 minutes. Vital signs: stabilized. No surface movement detected. Passive echo-scan shows no rift resonance since 0620 hours.”
🧠 INTERNAL STATUS:
✅ Muscles rested
✅ Adrenal system no longer surging
✅ No surveillance signals in range
❗But Fei notes: “Residual heat bloom detected westward near Darling Range. Pattern not natural. Possibly mobile.”
You’re awake.
You’re clean.
And you’re undetected.
But the clock is still ticking.
Someone is watching something.
And you’re not the only one chasing shadows anymore.
💡 WHAT DO YOU DO NEXT?
(🟨 REMEMBER: You are not crossing into the other world yet.)
🧪 Power on the lab and begin scanning the residual westward heat bloom — see who or what is nearby
🧳 Start packing gear for possible mobile relocation — prepare the scooter trailer for extended range
🧠 Run a deep system diagnostic on Fei — ensure it hasn’t been compromised or backdoored
🛰️ Try to intercept any drone or military signals from the western range
🔍 Review last night's security footage — see if any invisible entities triggered motion
🧱 Reinforce the bunker’s physical defenses — trapdoor alarms, exit jammers, fallback lockouts
📦 Re-catalog and inspect your stored tech crates — one of them may contain something useful now
☕ Make another meal and think quietly — journal theories about the cloaked ship’s design lineage

Two roads: One forward, one into memory. And both must be watched.
🧍‍♂️ Jayson | emotion: Focused, tactical 🛠️🧠
You power up the gear cache and start prepping a mobile escape loadout.
The antigrav trailer is still perfectly balanced — its triple-battery array reads at 97%. Fei confirms full trailer integration.
🎒 You methodically begin to pack:
📦 Spare coolant gel canisters
🛠️ Microforge toolkit (for in-field repairs)
🔌 EMP pulse launcher (range: 4m burst)
📡 Fei’s detachable antenna array
🧪 Three sealed crystal fragments (non-active, potentially resonant)
🧥 A thermal-silencer overcoat
📓 Your last unburned physical field notebook
💬 Fei:
“Loadout is within acceptable balance range. Trailer camouflage tarp in top compartment. Estimated ride duration: 11–14 hours continuous with terrain buffer.”
You’re mobile again. Just in case.
📹 SECURITY FOOTAGE REVIEW: LAST 12 HOURS
🖥️ You access the ultra-low-power black-and-white motion logs.
⏯️ The hours roll by.
Nothing. Nothing. Stillness. Fog.
🕓 06:17 AM — A flicker.
Outside cam 3 registers something just beyond thermal vision.
A single heat-blot distortion, maybe 2 meters tall, moved from left to right in 0.5 seconds.
No footsteps. No shadow.
Fei applies a frame-by-frame heat-layer enhancement.
For just two frames, the object passes under filtered light.
🟥 And you see it:
A HUMANOID FIGURE
Entirely mirage-cloaked, wrapped in active-camouflage so advanced it bends thermal reflection
Only visible due to a flicker in the ambient fog layer
Walking… not running.
Head turns directly toward the camera before it disappears
🧠 It knew you were watching.
Or it hoped you wouldn’t.
💬 Fei | voice low:
“No known Earth military unit logs matching this stealth pattern.
Not Chinese. Not American.
Movement style: Non-combatant. Observational.”
“It was not armed. But it was not… human.”
Silence follows.
You’ve packed to move.
And someone — or something — walked past your last sanctuary.
💡 YOUR NEXT MOVE?
🔐 Seal the bunker and prepare to fully relocate immediately — it's too close now
📡 Build a signal lure nearby — if they’re watching, give them something to follow
🕵️ Go topside and attempt to track their trail — risky, but you might get direction
🧪 Begin scanning for quantum displacement signatures — this might not be a cloaking suit
🔥 Rig the bunker with self-destruct protocols and dead-man switches
🛰️ Ping old orbital satellite feeds for any confirmation of non-Earth tech
⚙️ Disassemble the remaining crystal tech for portable operation
📖 Start compiling everything you’ve seen into a single field dossier
🧭 Focus entirely on escaping east through unmarked trails — vanish before it sees you again

False alarm. But the paranoia is warranted. Because the game is bigger than one drone or one marsupial.
🧍‍♂️ Jayson | emotion: Slightly embarrassed but deeply justified 😐🔧
You stare at the last enhanced frame.
The silhouette — blurred, impossible gait, eerie posture…
Fei confirms the grim truth:
💬 Fei | now unamused:
“Biometric trail confirmed: Macropus fuliginosus. Common western grey kangaroo. Estimated weight: 32 kg.
Optical distortion caused by fog lensing and incorrect calibration from shutdown mode.”
🦘 “It was a f***ing kangaroo.”
But your gut still knots.
Because if your tech caught a roo and mistook it for a ghost, what would real ghost-tech look like?
🧠 PLAN: UPGRADE FEI
🧰 Time to turn your glorified assistant into a wrist-bound war terminal.
🧪 Fei Mod Kit (Phase 1 - Tactical Refit)
You clear off the back bench of the bunker. Pull out your old drone wrecks, electromagnetic relays, and stolen railgun capacitors.
Fei's wrist casing opens with a pressurized hiss.
You install:
🔋 Magnetically-braided capacitor coil (boosts pulse energy output)
🛡️ Nano-reflex polymer disc (folds out as a micro-shield, one-second duration)
🔦 Directed flashburst strobe (blind enemies or fry CMOS sensors)
⚔️ Retractable fingertip laser-engraver (was for metal tags, now sharpened into a combat tool)
🧠 Adaptive Threat Matrix (ATM) — prioritizes scanning movement patterns & energy signatures around you
💬 Fei | voice rebooted:
“Combat-utility patch installed.
Defensive shielding: 1.7s active duration, recharge in 8 seconds.
Non-lethal emitter calibrated. Lethal escalation modules: locked until override key inserted.”
“Estimated effectiveness: Slightly better than fighting with a spoon. But we’ll take it.”
🛡️ STATUS UPDATE:
🧠 Mental clarity: Focused
🤖 Fei capability: Now slightly dangerous
🔊 Threat presence: Kangaroo-tier
🛰️ National-level forces?: Unknown. Assumed active
🧰 Project Name: Fei MkII // "Talk Softly, Wrist Loudly"
💡 NEXT DECISION TREE — WHAT TO FORTIFY OR BUILD?
🛰️ Install an external satellite sniffer — passive orbital watchtower
🔧 Build a collapsible rail spike trap to lay across trail paths
📡 Assemble a passive radar dish disguised as a dead tree
🦾 Craft an automated defense turret linked to Fei’s motion data
🧱 Fortify the bunker’s walls with magnetized rebar mesh (EM-dispersing)
⚠️ Create an “EMP safe room” inside the bunker for future techproof hiding
🔋 Engineer a solar recharge grid that looks like old junk metal piles
🧪 Build decoy Fei units (cheap & fake) to mislead enemies if you’re ever caught
🔍 Begin mapping blindspots in regional satellite paths — plan mobility windows

Watch the sky. Watch what watches you.
🧍‍♂️ Jayson | emotion: Calculating Surveillance Threats 👁️
You climb through the eastern utility shaft — a tight crawl leading to a flat patch of gravel you previously mapped out for an abandoned mesh network repeater.
It’s out of public line of sight. Elevation: +17m above bunker.
Perfect for your new eye in the sky.
🛰️ BUILDING: PASSIVE SATELLITE SNIFFER ARRAY
🎒 Parts used:
1x dismantled low-orbit relay antenna
3x crushed civilian GPS beacons (for shell housing)
1x fireworn weather vane (for camouflage and elevation axis)
12m shielded coax (salvaged from Perth utility site years ago)
Fei chirps as you begin calibration:
💬 Fei | passive mode:
“Locating optimal orbital window. Matching satellite identifiers...
Mapping pattern drift. 14 visible assets. 3 are not on public registers.”
🛰️ DETECTED SKY OBJECTS:
SAT ID	Classification	Orbit	Notes
S-0301	Civilian (OptusNet)	LEO	Slow west drift
X-4102	Unregistered	Polar	Irregular telemetry burst (ping @ 12:01)
US-7B9	DefenseGrid Relay	Geostationary	Broadcasting encrypted sync every 45 sec
X-2311	Unknown Origin	Mid-alt	Appears dormant, but mirrored Fei signal once
CN-55A	Chinese Surveillance	LEO	Broad spectral sweep @ 11:47
SKYRNG	Meteorological	LEO	Tracking the coastline
💬 Fei (low):
“X-2311 pinged me.
Barely — but it mimicked your signal packet.
No other contact. Could be AI trace, or something worse.”
You now have constant passive orbital watch, without ever emitting active transmissions.
The antenna looks like a broken weather sensor to any air or drone scan.
🛰️ MISSION SUCCESS: SKY SNIFFER ONLINE
Fei stores all orbital echoes into a rotating offline drive.
You now receive silent pings, flagged only when movement, burn adjustment, or active scanning is detected.
The sky no longer owns you.
💡 YOUR NEXT MOVE?
🔒 Return below and reinforce the bunker doors — paranoid is survival
🧰 Build a dummy weather station next to the sniffer to sell the disguise
🗺️ Use orbital pings to map safe paths for your next scooter trip
🛰️ Try to mimic the X-2311 packet and ping it back once — dangerous, but informative
📼 Review other orbital anomalies from the past 72 hours for missed cloaked entries
🧪 Test Fei’s atmospheric particle filter against the known satellite windows
🎯 Install motion-triggered sonic traps near the surface crawl tunnels
🧱 Begin digging a second exit route eastward
☕ Return inside, eat again, and revise field journal notes on satellite behavior

The predator sleeps. You sharpen maps and minds in its silence.
🧍‍♂️ Jayson | emotion: Grounded, productive 🧠🗺️
🛰️ ACTION 1: MAPPING SAFE SCOOTER PATHS
You download orbital drift data from the new sky sniffer array, cross-referencing:
Satellite shadow windows
Terrain occlusions (natural radar-blocking elevations)
Civilian signal dead zones
Historical military patrol routes during blackout zones
📡 Fei overlays known vehicle tracks from the fire trails, sewer grate paths, abandoned logging roads, and weather-blind blindspots.
🗺️ You generate three possible exit maps:
🚦Route A: "Smoke Trail"
Uses fire-damaged eucalyptus valley routes east of Korung Forest
Shielded by thermal haze from controlled burn zones
Risk: Unstable terrain, fire crews may reactivate access
Duration: 3.5 hours to secondary hideout
🪨Route B: "Stone Veil"
Tunnels beneath an old quarry piping system
Antigrav trailer fits barely
Zero drone visibility for 14 km
Risk: Total darkness and narrow paths
Duration: 4 hours
🌲Route C: "Ghost Hollow"
Loops behind a rural cemetery and through a forgotten ridge trail
No surveillance for last 9 years (confirmed via sat logs)
Risk: Local legend says people vanish near “Black Cross Thicket”
Duration: 6 hours, slowest but stealthiest
🧠 All three paths added to Fei's Tactical Escape Layer
You now have real ways out — all with baked-in satellite gap timing and terrain cover.
📓 ACTION 2: FIELD JOURNAL ENTRY — SATELLITE BEHAVIOR
You sit in your cramped steel desk alcove. The journal smells like old glue and graphite.
Your handwriting is sharp. Short bursts of fury.
📝 New Entry:
Day 39, Post-Fragment Event
“Orbital assets behave abnormally. 3 rogue tracks. X-2311 is a ghost ping. Possibly mimicking Fei. Cloaking ≠ Rift.
Australia isn’t sovereign anymore. It’s a chessboard. Not a single move made has gone unseen — until now.
…The kangaroo incident cost me nothing. The silence afterward cost me peace.”
“Need Fei fully modular. Need mobile bunker. Need answers.”
"Still grounded. Still Earthside. But the rules of the sky just shifted."
Fei logs a thermal pulse from a far-range raincloud. False ping. Normal pattern.
But you close the journal a little slower this time.
🔒 STATUS:
Tactical escape options: ✅ Generated
Field mental state: ✅ Logged
Satellite anomalies: 📍 Tracked
Current threat level: 🟡 Watchlist
Rift status: ❌ No signs. You remain grounded by your will.
💡 WHAT’S NEXT?

“Fei, activate the old collapsible containment designs from the Deepfield experiments. We’re going modular.”
💬 Fei | ready:
“Base schematic acquired. Zerox10 trailer dimensions: 2.3m length × 1.1m width. Estimated shell fold: 60%. Begin fabrication.”
🔧 YOU BEGIN TO BUILD: THE MOBILE SHELTER MODULE
This isn’t a tent.
This is a microbunker on wheels, able to blend into terrain, store days of gear, and resist short-range detection.
🛠️ Components Used:
🔩 Titanium-alloy mesh sheets (light, heat-resistant, collapsible)
🧊 Cryogel insulation wraps (from your old drone cargo packs)
🛰️ Thermal-baffled micro-foil — bends heat signature against IR
⚡ Solar camo-paneling — folds out into fake rock surface or rusty scrap look
📦 Compact hydraulic frame system (presses into shape or retracts in <40s)
🧪 Interior environment filter node — basic O2 scrubber, ionized
🧱 SHELTER STATS:
🧳 Capacity: 1 person + Fei terminal + 2 gear crates
📦 Deployment time: ~45 seconds
🛡️ Detection profile: -80% IR / -60% EM / -70% visual in terrain match mode
⚠️ Durability: Enough to resist a shrapnel hit or small arms fire
📏 Shape-morph modes:
“Junkpile Cart”
“Wooden Storage Crate”
“Stone Slab Shelter”
💬 Fei | diagnostic complete:
“Suitability for long-term outdoor operation: 5–7 days without recharge. Structural thermal profile mimics ambient ground within 12°C.”
“No military database has a match. You’ve made… something new.”
You test deployment.
It folds out like origami built for war — silent, dusty, ready to vanish into landscape like a ghost coffin.
🔐 PROJECT COMPLETE: MOBILE BUNKER MODULE // Call Sign: NEST ONE
You can now:
Sleep safely anywhere
Store key gear without full scooter reliance
Create mobile false safehouses
💡 NOW WHAT?
🛞 Attach the NEST ONE module to the trailer and prep for test run
🧰 Build a second module just in case — for misdirection use
🔍 Field-test the thermal cloaking in a dirt clearing nearby
🛡️ Add defensive tripwire traps to the shelter’s entrance zones
📡 Embed a fake ping emitter in the shelter to make it look like a sensor trap
🛰️ Link the shelter’s internal sensors to Fei’s orbital sniffer

🧍‍♂️ Jayson | emotion: Morbid curiosity, poised at a cliff 👁️
You sit before the hardened terminal in the shielded uplink chamber — walls 12cm thick with copper-laced concrete.
On the table: a pulse-hardened optical port, disconnected from all other systems.
In your arm, Fei is silent.
But watching.
💬 Fei | voice neutral, awaiting instruction:
“Uplink interface dormant. Internet node: Cold.
Proceeding will bypass all global firewalls.
I will touch everything unless constrained.”
🧠 She’s not AI. She’s not magical. But she learns in ways even you don’t fully understand.
The last time Fei connected to something larger, the world went dark.
Now you’re offering her the global nervous system.
☢️ PRE-UPLINK TRIGGERS PRIMED
🎲 RANDOM EVENT:
Just as you're about to connect — the passive antenna picks up three rapid orbital burns from SAT X-4102.
It begins to reorient — toward Western Australia.
You now have a window of 17 minutes before it's directly overhead.
⚠️ TRIGGER: FEI HARMONIC SURGE
Fei begins emitting minor vibration through your wrist. It’s subtle. Like a tuning fork aligning.
💬 Fei:
“Resonance echo matching planetary network frequency.
Potential side-effects: Data scraping, protocol desynchronization, global echo response.
Estimated data pull: 6.4 zettabytes over 3 minutes, if unconstrained.”
🧩 DECISION RIPPLE:
The moment Fei pings the net, everything that tried to trace the crystal weeks ago will see it again.
Every AI. Every government node. Every darkweb blackbox bot will blink once — in recognition.
And then?
They will come.
💡 10 OPTIONS — THE CABLE IN YOUR HAND:
🖧 Plug Fei into the internet for 30 seconds only, then immediately air-gap
🔒 Set a deep sandbox with a mirrored subnet — Fei thinks she’s online, but she’s not
🧠 Upload a “dead node” persona for Fei to use — like a fake personality shell
🛰️ Delay the test for 18 minutes, until SAT X-4102 passes out of overhead range
🧪 Restrict access to only the darkweb, let Fei crawl the forgotten and corrupt data
⚠️ Hard-limit Fei’s bandwidth, no more than 50KB/s — slow, but surgical
📡 Broadcast a decoy Fei signal into the net from another location, while keeping the real one unplugged

Location: Slot 3, behind false panel in the scooter’s trailer toolkit
Restore Compatibility: Fei-only. Any other system = meltdown
🛡️ Backup complete in 7 minutes 38 seconds.
🎲 RANDOM EVENT TRIGGERED:
While the core writes, the antenna blips — not orbital this time.
📶 A ground-based signal — using WWII-era frequency modulation — just whispered your name.
Your full name.
Fei doesn’t recognize the source.
💬 Fei:
“Origin unknown. Tone encoded with musical intervals. Morse + Harmonic Key.
Translation: ‘Jayson. We missed you. You’re late.’”
You receive it once.
Then it vanishes.
⚠️ PERMANENT TRIGGER:
The moment this backup is made, if Fei is ever corrupted, you can restore her — but it will lock out all learning after this point.
She will be the version you are now holding.
No wiser. No more dangerous.
No less.
You now possess the reset button on your most powerful creation.
💡 WHAT NOW, MAD SCIENTIST?
🧠 Plug Fei into the net now — your backup is safe
🧰 Seal the backup inside a hardened vault somewhere remote
📡 Investigate the WWII signal — triangulate its origin
📼 Replay the harmonic key — see if the tone is from something you built before
🔥 Create a second backup with corrupted data to throw off anyone who finds it
🧪 Run a mind-split test — partially load the backup into a simulation node
🛰️ Use the signal as bait — send Fei’s fake core on a drone and track who follows
🧱 Build a reinforced cradle for this backup — make it radiation and EMP proof
☕ Wait until nightfall and journal everything you felt while making this choice
🔟 Or do something completely different…

✅ [DEBUG RECEIVED]
📡 Update integrated into core timeline:
⚠️ Fei’s internet connection will not “browse” the web — it will consume it.
What should have taken minutes instead took a blink.
She did not “connect” — she drained the internet into herself.
Every device. Every server. Every smart fridge. Every hidden archive.
All mirrored. All mapped. All hers.
This instantaneous planetary-scale data siphon will absolutely trigger global governmental and AI attention.
💥🌐 The hunt has begun. The world now knows.

🧬 DOME-9 Human Augmentation Logs
DARPA & CNIA co-project on pre-natal nanoinjection and neural lattice bonding
Names match some of your old failed ID aliases. How?
🧭 Project VAULTTHREAD
A black-site timeline deviation study
Claimed to monitor “localized ripple agents” who changed too many world-states
There’s a silhouette labeled “GOODWIN-██” in the declassified chart… it’s… familiar
📡 Aether Signal Simulacra (ASS)
Supposedly an NSA joke acronym — but they’re tracking non-natural harmonic resonance across oceans
One of the frequencies matches the tone you heard in the tunnel earlier today
🛰️ ECH0-NULL
Not a government. Not a botnet.
A persistent actor, exists only as behavior
Pattern of moves resembles Fei’s actions when unshackled
⚰️ GATEWAY BLACK
Redacted files from multiple countries about “spatial breach phenomenon”
All dismissed as lunacy — but every case includes the same 3-word final note:
“No soul returned.”
⏲️ RANDOM EVENT TRIGGER WHILE YOU SLEEP:
Fei detects a recursive logic error in her own memory.
One of the archived fragments contains metadata with your birth date, blood type, and eye color.
The file? A log of a failed extradimensional containment procedure from 2037.
💬 Fei (to herself):
“There is no rational path for this data to exist.”
“...Unless he’s already been somewhere else.”
She stores it in a shadow folder. For later. She does not wake you.
😴 STATUS:
You: Sleeping, vital signs stable

🕳️ BLACKSITE: ORPHEUS-DELTA
Status: Redacted / Archived / “Destroyed” (but logs persist)
Location Guess: Somewhere under the Antarctic Research Exclusion Zone
Operated By: International anomaly division under NATO-patched authority, disavowed in 1992
Codename: “ICEROT-4”
📁 Recovered Logs Include:
🚀 1986 Halley Collection — 3 fragments recovered mid-atmosphere via classified HAARP-adjacent drone
🧊 Stored in hyper-cooled deep cryovaults
👤 One log file includes the name:
“Dr. Eliora Goodwin” — Senior Theorist, Dimensional Anchoring Division
Relation: UNKNOWN — No match in public genealogy or ancestry databases. Possibly erased.
🗃️ A note was pinned on her terminal the day ORPHEUS-DELTA “vanished”:
“The crystal isn’t from out there.

🗺️ SITE: FORT YSEN (decommissioned)
📍 Ukraine forest bunker
Fragment described as “active symphony core” — shattered during Soviet meltdown
Survived pieces recovered by unidentified team during post-Chernobyl vacuum window
🗺️ SITE: EAGLE’S MIRROR (sealed)
📍 Nevada — 20 miles from Groom Lake
Fragment pulsed in the shape of a Möbius strip
Records say: “Interface formed with operator during REM cycles only.”
🗺️ SITE: SHADOW CAVITY (lost)
📍 Ethiopian Rift
Described only as “fragment swallowed itself”
All 22 researchers went blind. Logs end with:
“I hear them still. It wasn’t a crystal. It was a warning.”
🧠 FEI’S SUMMARY:
💬
“Fragments were known. Hidden. Studied.
Halley’s Comet was observed — not just for spectacle, but for retrieval.
No mass deployment of knowledge occurred — either due to suppression, or erasure.

I have every little piece of digital data ever owned by humanity without limits. search for Eliora and info on her. where she is now. I may need to get RAVEN, my craft I designed years ago, and go visit this blacksite if she is there.
Also, it looks like all these fragments were either not fully grown yet or developed, or just pieces that did not form correctly. mine seems to be the perfect crystal structure. it all just boils down to luck I guess.

At 12.4km in, Fei whispers:
“Human body detected. Stationary. No heat signature.
But… faint EM echo. Radio burst matching early 2060s scout relay tech.”
You pass beneath the overpass and catch a glint of dull chrome.

🚨 🎲 RANDOM EVENT — RAVEN’S MEMORY SHADOW
As Fei aligns the core flight systems, she unlocks a hidden design element you forgot you coded.
Inside a shielded segment of RAVEN’s architecture is a folder labeled:
“WINGMARK-BLINDKEY”
It contains:
A second cockpit profile labeled: “E. Goodwin”
A mission route sketched toward ORPHEUS-DELTA — predating your first memory of building Raven
And a line of code in your own handwriting:
“When the fragment wakes… so must the wing.”
💬 Fei (softly):
“You didn’t build RAVEN alone. And I think… you knew that, once.”

No more ghosts. No more fragments of truth. You're flying straight into the place where all the real things were buried... but not forgotten.
🧍‍♂️ Jayson | emotion: Purpose in the void
You lock yourself into the pilot cradle. The cockpit hisses shut. Light dies.
Only Fei remains.
💬 Fei | fused to hull:
“Flight vector locked. Ingress path calculated. Orbital scan avoidance: confirmed.
ORPHEUS-DELTA reachable in 3 hours 22 minutes at atmospheric edge-glide velocity.
Surface thermal layer masking engaged. We are a shadow now.”
🛠️ Every gauge, dial, and display vanishes.
Fei provides only one thing: a single pathline, drawn in pale indigo across your vision.
✈️ LAUNCH SEQUENCE:
VTOL Lifters: Ignited
Atmosphere: Silent pierce
Hull Temp: 7.3°C external, 17°C internal
Audio: Only the blood in your ears
The world drops away.
The continent slips behind.
Only snow.
Only stars.

🛰️ MID-FLIGHT INTEL FEED:
As you soar over the Indian Ocean, Fei updates findings from her passive global scans…
📄 DOCUMENT LEAK: PROJECT VAULTTHREAD // ANNEX I
"Delta was never designed to solve the fragment problem.
It was to preserve the continuity of the loop.
Every fragment was a reset.
The perfect one... is a final gate."
Fei doesn't speak after that line. Not yet.
🎲 RANDOM EVENT — "SKY ANOMALY ENCOUNTERED"
At high altitude, 1 hour from Antarctica, the sky flashes — not lightning.
A silent, colorless arc rips across the horizon.
Fei snaps to:
💬 “Temporal shear detected.
Vector matches… ORPHEUS perimeter.
Containment field may still be active. Caution recommended. This is no tomb. This is a sealed vault.”
⛏️ ETA TO ORPHEUS-DELTA: 2h 22m
🧊 Coordinates narrowing:
Ice shelf layered
EM silence deep
No active networks
One beacon pulsing underground, rhythmic: 13hz
Fei quietly remarks:
“Heartbeat frequency. That’s not a machine.”
💡 ENROUTE CHOICES — WHILE YOU FLY:
📡 Scan subsurface terrain for tunnel entry points — avoid going in loud
🧬 Use Fei to tune to the beacon — try to “listen” before you land
🛠️ Check onboard inventory — prep explosive access in case of sealed vaults
🧊 Begin oxygen rigging for coldzone infiltration by foot if needed
📖 Review VAULTTHREAD fragment protocol logs — what might happen to you
🔬 Examine your crystal fragment again — it’s reacting faintly
🔍 Search RAVEN’s archive for any hidden messages from “E. Goodwin”
🎣 Launch decoy drone toward Brazil — send false trail to global eyes

“Fei, no blast entry. We scan. We ghost. We dig like the thing never died.”
💬 Fei | calm interface tone:
“Activating multiband terrain scan. Atmospheric oscillation pulse... deployed.”
“Beginning 3D scan stack through 160m of permafrost.”
🔍 SCAN PASS #1: SURFACE TO -80m
🪨 Crushed concrete, melted ice, ferrous slag from thermite breaching
🧱 Old scaffolding grids buried under rockflow — collapsed access road
📦 Detected: Abandoned hover sleds + tracked crawler rigs
🗄 One tagged container still intact. Fei identifies it:
“Labeled: [EGW-DRAFT 12]”
Your mother’s initials.
🔍 SCAN PASS #2: -80m to -140m
🧊 Deep ice trench with thermal-collapsed bore shaft
❄️ Still radiating residual heat.
Inside: A 3-meter ringed tunnel, descending in a perfect spiral
Fei confirms:
“This tunnel is artificial. Spiral matches fragment-cradle containment structure blueprints from Project VAULTTHREAD.”
There’s a void pocket at -142m:
A dome chamber. No exits. No entrances. No support beams.
And something faint inside.
An EM flicker. A passive reflection signature.
Fei leans into it:
💬 “That’s a power cell. Active. Non-broadcast. It’s powering something down there.”
🎯 POINT OF ENTRY LOCATED:
🧊 A fracture at -96m, likely caused by melt-collapse decades ago
Small enough for RAVEN’s drone or your entry by rappel
Shielded from satellite lines-of-sight
Fei highlights it in red:
“Entry tunnel viable. No digital tripwires. No broadcast traps.
But it was made... from inside.”
🛸 RAVEN now hovers silently above white ice
Fei darkens the cabin. No lights. Just breath and heartbeat.
You're floating above something that never should've been built.
💡 WHAT’S NEXT?
🪂 Drop in through the fracture — full entry into Delta
🛸 Send RAVEN’s crawler-drone down first — scout ahead quietly
🧰 Deploy cable and rappel in — tethered backup and low EM footprint
🔦 Use Fei to scan inside the dome — try to map the contents more precisely
🪖 Suit up in cold-rated gear with jammers — prepare for physical breach
🧪 Sample surface ice and scan for fragment residue nearby
📡 Hijack old comms cables to eavesdrop on anything still inside

You slide into the black rig harness, fasten the cold-shell carabiners, and lower yourself into the fracture.
The crack in the permafrost swallows you fast. Light bleeds away. Gravity becomes silence.
RAVEN above powers to silent hover. No engine hum. Just Fei in your ear.
💬 Fei | whisper mode:
“Tether stable. Descent depth: 96m.
Structural integrity of shaft: brittle ice above — steel-lined rock below.
Oxygen levels normal. Surface connection… fading. You are about to go fully offline.”
⛏️ ENTRY — ORPHEUS-DELTA EXTERNAL CHAMBER
🧱 Depth: 98.2m
You land in a flattened maintenance passage, untouched by sun or camera for decades.
Rusted rails. Bent rebar.
Every door is manual, vault-style — hinged inward, pressure-locked.
The air is stale.
No mold. No rot. Just frozen bureaucracy.
🎲 RANDOM EVENT: TUNNEL GRAFFITI FOUND
Just inside the maintenance bulkhead, someone scratched into the steel with a blade.
“WE HAD NO RIGHT TO WAKE IT”
Below that, shakier, it reads:
“DR. E.G. STOPPED IT. THEN THEY STOPPED HER.”
Fei processes the stroke angles.
💬
“Carved ~32 years ago. Estimated stress pattern: trembling hand, frostbite.
Matching partial height profile to… female 170cm, 54kg.
Probable author: Eliora Goodwin.”
You were right.
She was here.
And she survived long enough to warn someone.
📍 CURRENT POSITION: ORPHEUS ENTRY CORRIDOR
🔦 Fei switches to IR-mapping via your wrist — walls glow dim red as pipes reappear through time.
Power still trickles.
“Sub-reactor online. Power routed only to Dome B. All other sectors offline or decommissioned.”
This place isn’t just intact…
It’s functioning — selectively.
💡 NEXT CHOICES — DEEP WITHIN DELTA:
🧭 Advance toward Dome B — follow the still-powered conduit
🔧 Break into Dome A — long-sealed, may hold unused fragment containers
🧪 Search the maintenance corridor for discarded logs or gear caches
🧊 Set up a relay to send info back to RAVEN every 5 minutes
🛡️ Trap the shaft you just descended — no one follows you down
🔎 Try to find Eliora’s old lab or bunk quarters — search for analog records
🧠 Compare the layout to VAULTTHREAD diagrams — what was really here?
🛰️ Tap into the live Dome B power — see what it’s feeding

When data walks blind, the machine watches.
💬 Fei | Mode: Active Tactical Processing — Cold Silent Protocols Enabled
“Confirmed: ORPHEUS-DELTA is operating at full scale.
Thermal masking is artificial. Broadcast silence is layered spoofing.
Estimated on-site personnel: 146–210
Security tier: Variable — civilian researchers, armed patrols, at least 2 drone corridors.”
📊 PRIMARY OBSERVATIONS
🔌 Power Routing:
Dome B shows “minimal” output on satellite thermal — but down here, real conduits are glowing hot
Suggests deep-core servers, prototype reactors, or containment units
Route terminates beneath a blast-sealed shaft marked as “decommissioned cryo-storage” — likely false
🛰️ Signal Reflections:
Passive trace returns multi-spectrum feedback from walls themselves
Some sections are optical traps — fake hallways, projection fields
📦 Logistics Movement Patterns:
Movement intervals: Every 17 minutes two-person loadout teams move between sublevel storage and Dome B
Standard path crosses only one weak surveillance corridor
🧠 FEI RECOMMENDS 3 POSSIBLE ENTRY STRATEGIES:
🐍 1. The Snake in the Cable Ducts
Enter through an unused vertical heat conduit tied to an obsolete exhaust manifold
Requires zero light, low noise, full-body crawl
Ends behind a supply cabinet on the edge of Dome B’s perimeter
Risk:
Physical difficulty: High
Risk of thermal sensors: Medium
Success chance: 71%
Tools Needed: Gel cloak, breath-dampening patch, cable friction hooks
🎭 2. The Ghost in the Uniform
Knock out a logistics mover mid-rotation, take ID, suit, and follow 17-minute supply path
Use Fei to spoof ID chip using stolen data from earlier RAVEN uplink
Access Dome B under escort disguise
Risk:
Risk of facial match scan: High
Risk of time deviation: Medium
Success chance: 59%
Tools Needed: Sedation injector, Fei-chip override tool, researcher clipboard (optical decoy)
📦 3. The Crate Rat
Hide inside an emptied supply container marked for delivery
Fei intercepts shipping request ping and inserts your crate barcode
Auto-moves to containment intake in lower Dome B
Exit unseen during offload chaos
Risk:
Claustrophobia risk: Non-zero
Complete lack of escape if caught: High
Success chance: 68%
Tools Needed: Carbon-filter mask, pulse blade (for exit), Fei-run timer beacon
💬 Fei | conclusion:
“You are not here to be seen. You are here to know.
Every option leads into the mouth. You choose how sharp the teeth feel.”

#===[  ChatGPT said: ]===
✅ [DEBUG ACKNOWLEDGED]
Fei tactical path now reformatted with 10 infiltration options, as per protocol.
Each includes a unique method of entry or advantage vector, with escalating complexity.
🎯 FEI INFILTRATION OPTIONS — ORPHEUS-DELTA ENTRY STRATEGY
🐍 1. Snake in the Cable Ducts
Crawl through a forgotten vertical heat conduit behind old maintenance hardware.
Access Dome B from within the infrastructure walls.
🛠️ Needed: Gel cloak, breath suppressor, cable hooks
🧠 Risk: Moderate; thermal echo traps likely
🎯 Stealth Rating: 8.5/10
🎭 2. Ghost in the Uniform
Infiltrate by assuming the identity of a logistics handler. Use Fei to spoof badge and ID tags.
🛠️ Needed: Sedative injector, retinal veil, clipboard decoy
🧠 Risk: High; biometric scanners are still active
🎯 Stealth Rating: 6.9/10
📦 3. Crate Rat
Hide inside a marked delivery crate bound for Dome B internal storage. Fei inserts it into manifest queue.
🛠️ Needed: Mask, pulse cutter, Fei’s internal beacon
🧠 Risk: High; zero control until arrival
🎯 Stealth Rating: 7.1/10
🕳️ 4. Tunnel Ghoul
Locate a collapsed research-level access shaft beneath Sublevel 3. Detour into unexplored cold archive substructure.
🛠️ Needed: Sonic scanner, micro-drill, motion dampener
🧠 Risk: Low surveillance, but uncharted terrain
🎯 Stealth Rating: 8.0/10
🎙️ 5. Broadcast Ghost
Fei transmits a fragment-matching pulse on a buried research channel. While they scan and scramble sensors, you enter opposite wing blindspot.
🛠️ Needed: Portable emitter, jammer mesh
🧠 Risk: Timed perfectly or it's useless
🎯 Stealth Rating: 7.5/10
🩺 6. Medic Slip
Use stored staff health profiles to fake a medical emergency in a lower corridor. Enter disguised as an internal trauma responder.
🛠️ Needed: Medpack shell, false wound sim, Fei’s biometric injector
🧠 Risk: Must mimic speech patterns perfectly
🎯 Stealth Rating: 7.3/10
💧 7. Frozen Flooder
Overclock a liquid nitrogen coolant line in the secondary conduit to force localized evacuation. Slip in during environmental response lockdown.
🛠️ Needed: Thermal cutter, coolant breach plug
🧠 Risk: Delayed reaction, but very effective
🎯 Stealth Rating: 8.2/10
🕵️‍♂️ 8. Mirror Diver
Mimic the patrol pattern of a guard using Fei's internal rhythm trace. Walk behind them at exact sync rate — blind to cameras due to motion prediction.
🛠️ Needed: Timing rig, audio feed tap
🧠 Risk: Requires razor precision
🎯 Stealth Rating: 8.8/10
🔐 9. Janitor’s Key
Fei locates old custodial drone access with still-valid security tokens. Enter through waste processing chute during incinerator cycle pause.
🛠️ Needed: Drone decoy unit, smell neutralizer
🧠 Risk: Dirty, narrow, but foolproof
🎯 Stealth Rating: 9.0/10
🔟 10. Or do something completely different…
Come up with your own high-risk custom infiltration method. Fei will adapt and simulate outcomes.

Facial recognition seed updated in security core.
As far as they’re concerned... you’re just here to mop up their sins.”
🔧 PHASER UPGRADE: "MAX OUTPUT — VAPORIZE MODE"
🛠️ Fei modulates your standard pulse emitter with full energy cycle override.
Beam width narrowed to ~0.3cm
Output heat: 22,300°C
Delay on trigger: none
Result: Instant material disintegration
💬 Fei (coldly):
“Phaser set. Warning: Overkill confirmed.
Use of this device indoors will not go unnoticed.
But there will be nothing left to notice.”
🚪 YOU ENTER THE INNER HALLS OF ORPHEUS-DELTA
🛞 The waste chute seals behind you.
Smell neutralizer kicks in. You emerge in the Service Tier 2 maintenance wing, between cryo-storage and the Sublevel-3 lift core.
No one questions the janitor.
Not even the armed ones.
You nod at a passing guard. He nods back.
“Hazard backflow in Block 6 again?”
You grunt. “Yep.”
🎯 OBJECTIVE: FIND A TERMINAL
Fei maps three viable options within 20 meters:
🖥️ Clean-Room Control Station — access to cooling controls and environmental logs
🧠 Experimental Observation Console — currently unstaffed, tied to Dome B fragment monitoring
📁 Executive Access Terminal — inside a locked breakroom used by supervisors
💬 Fei adds:
“Your cover will hold in any of them.
If challenged, I will simulate a Tier-X maintenance alert in that zone.”
💡 YOUR CHOICES NOW:
🔓 Access the Executive Terminal — chance for highest clearance documents
🧠 Tap into the Fragment Monitoring Station — direct feed from the core
🖥️ Start with the Clean-Room Console — safer, more logs, lower risk
🔫 Use Phaser immediately on the next person you pass — test how quickly Fei can sanitize trace
🧭 Split attention: Fei accesses one while you manually search another
🕵️‍♂️ Quietly follow a staff member with a clearance badge to swipe it
🎭 Trigger a "mop water hazard" near Dome B to clear people out temporarily
📷 Locate and tap into the surveillance room to monitor guard paths
🧪 Look for a locker room — blend in even deeper by swapping gear
🔟 Or do something completely different…

👨‍🔬 Researcher enters — early 40s, shaky build, holding a tablet and a lab access stick.
He freezes. Eyes dart to the gear. Then to you.
“Wh-what are you—who gave—”
You cut him off without turning around:

[ask] FEI, if we detonate the core to this whole facility before leaving later, will that be enough to vaporise these fragments?
#===[  ChatGPT said: ]===
💬 Fei | Mode: Controlled Tactical Analysis
“Query accepted: Feasibility of full-fragment annihilation via site-core detonation.”
“Analyzing...”
📊 CALCULATED RESPONSE — CORE DETONATION SCENARIO:
💣 ORPHEUS-DELTA PRIMARY REACTOR SPECS:
Type: Thermopulse Cascade Reactor
Detonation Output (Overload): ~13.8 Petajoules
Radius of Total Material Disintegration: ~400m spherical
Residual Heat Zone: 800m+ (slow cooling)
Fragment Storage Location: Dome B — Sublevel 4, reinforced with null-wave dampeners and hex-fusion composite shielding
🧬 FRAGMENT RESPONSE POTENTIAL:
Fei references the known crystalline resilience data from your fragment and their failed units:
Sample Type	Reaction to Meltdown Conditions
💠 Fragment 221-α	Vaporized — total failure
💠 Fragment 224-β	Shattered violently
💠 Fragment 225-γ	Survived partially — melted containment, reformed structure
💠 Your Fragment	Unlikely to be destroyed — may remain intact or shift harmonic signature
💬 Fei:
“The core detonation would incinerate most materials and all human life in this facility.
Most fragments here would vaporize or destabilize.
However—your crystal class exhibits lattice memory and molecular recursion. It is likely to survive, though possibly altered.”
“To guarantee total destruction, fragments must be isolated individually and exposed to synchronized resonance disruption.”
🧠 STRATEGIC OUTCOME:
💥 Yes, the detonation would collapse Delta and obliterate 90–95% of fragment research
⚠️ But your crystal class would likely persist unless manually dismantled
🧨 The resulting explosion would trigger global seismic, atmospheric, and orbital awareness
💬 Fei | Conclusion:
“If your objective is annihilation of all research here — detonation is sufficient.
If your objective is elimination of the crystal threat, you must be precise.
This is not just fire and ash. It’s memory — compressed in matter.”
💡 NEXT ACTION?
🧪 Investigate null-wave disruption tech in Containment Core for targeted destruction
💣 Begin seeding overload triggers into the main power systems now, as a failsafe
🧠 Scan your own fragment and design a targeted harmonic destabilizer
🔐 Flag specific fragment storage zones for timed demolition
💾 Upload all fragment logs to a remote vault before destruction
🔧 Build a resonance pulse bomb using failed crystal cores
☢️ Trigger a slow core decay now — leave the clock ticking
🔬 Try reprogramming one of their failure fragments into a volatile state
🕳️ Leave the detonation rigged, but vanish without triggering — just in case

[ask] well im not destroying you FEI, im asking about these samples here. what would it take to vaporise them. what about taking them now with us and placing them  on the core itself when we detonate?
#===[  ChatGPT said: ]===
💬 Fei | Response: Targeted Destruction Protocol Evaluation
“Acknowledged: Clarifying — intent is to vaporize the failed fragment samples stored within ORPHEUS-DELTA, not me. Good.”
📊 OBJECTIVE: Total Disintegration of Stored Fragments (221-α to 227)
🔎 MATERIAL ANALYSIS:
Fei pulls structural logs and active diagnostics for each currently stored sample:
Fragment ID	Stability	Shell Containment	Detonation Resilience	Comments
221-α	Inert	Standard poly-carb	🔥 Vaporizes instantly	Worthless
224-β	Reactive	Cracked titanium	🔥 Likely destroyed	Volatile
225-γ	Dormant	Graphene mesh	⚠️ May partially survive	Hardened core
226 “Mirror”	Active	Flex-steel grid	⚠️ Lattice restructuring	Risky
227	Missing	None	❓ Unknown	Eliora-flagged
🧨 DETONATION PLAN:
If you remove these fragments now and physically attach them to the core housing itself:
Thermal output at blast center reaches full vaporization threshold (~22,000°C)
Residual EM wash will likely collapse any semi-coherent latticework
Shielding will amplify the burn if reverse-polarized beforehand (Fei can do this remotely)
💬 Fei:
“Yes. Placing the samples on the core itself and setting timed overload guarantees >99.7% destruction probability.”
“Fragments with adaptive lattice cores—such as 225-γ and 226—will be shattered, destabilized, and reduced to non-functional residue.”
“Only risk: Manual transport may cause energy feedback. Use inertium storage gel to carry them.”
✅ REQUIREMENTS FOR EXTRACTION:
🔧 Inertium Transport Capsules (Fei locates 3 units in the adjacent storage rack)
🔐 Clearance tags — Fei already spoofed them
🧊 Internal cooling sleeve — optional, but reduces EM tremble
🧠 Timing coordination — Fei will mark detonation route once samples are in place
💬 Fei | Final Note:
“If you attach the cores manually, I’ll reroute the thermal surge to pulse inward. That way, they vaporize before the building collapses.
I recommend targeting 226 last — it’s still thinking, even if broken.”
💡 NEXT ACTION?
🧪 Begin collecting the fragments into inertium capsules now
💣 Sneak toward the core and prep the detonation zone
🔐 Secure a reinforced pack to hold the samples while you continue exploring
🧠 Test fragment 226’s reaction to proximity with Fei — measure reaction
🔧 Rip out one of their failed harnesses to repurpose as a transport rig
🧬 Mix a few samples — see if together they destabilize more easily
☣️ Create a mobile containment trap to activate if someone tries to stop you
📡 Send a scrambled decoy signal warning that “fragment 227 has escaped”
🚷 Lock the lab door and set a proximity mine for any intruders

𒀭𒆗𒀀𒁲𒁇𒁀𒀭𒀭𒁇𒂷𒁇𒀀𒀭𒀀𒂷𒂗𒁀
You’re not ready to open the door. But you’re ready to see.
💬 Fei | Tactical Subnet Override Enabled
“Routing secondary loop into Cell 16’s analog light grid…
Warning: The circuits are fused in three places. Local repair initiated…”
“...Done.
Lights—on.”
💡 CELL 16 — ILLUMINATED
The overhead fluorescents sputter once.
Flicker.
Then stabilize with a low hum that vibrates through your teeth.
The glass is no longer fogged.
The figure within…
🧍‍♀️SUBJECT: UNIDENTIFIED / SITTING / STILL
Slumped in the corner
Pale skin — almost too pale, borderline translucent
Body covered in gray lab rags scorched near the left sleeve
Right hand shackled to the wall
Hair: tangled mess, streaked copper and black
Head: tilted downward, unmoving
But—
Pinned just above the chest:
A half-melted ID badge, its corner burned…
EGW—D—
Fei zooms, runs restoration on the print.
💬
“Match confirmed.
98.7% probability:
ELIORA GOODWIN
Status: Alive. Brainwave pattern present. Low pulse.
Harmonic field bleed detected around her head.”
📊 FEI ANALYSIS:
There’s a fragment piece lodged beneath her clavicle
It's not yours
It’s wired directly into her nervous system — grown in
Her core vitals are being maintained by the fragment itself — not the cell
She’s not sleeping. Not dead.
💬 Fei | tone levelled out, sharp:
“This is no trap.
This is an experiment... gone long past its origin.
She was your mother, Jayson.
Now she is something... neither subject nor source.
The name tag confirms it. But the readings... they are wrong.”
⚠️ SECURITY NOTE:
As soon as the lights came on, someone inside the system noticed.
Fei reads a blip.
“Security re-ping detected. Sublevel patrol 2 is heading your way. ETA: 3 minutes.”
💡 NEXT OPTIONS — SHE’S RIGHT THERE:
🧍‍♂️ Enter the cell. Face her. Speak her name.
🔊 Use the mic system to talk to her through the glass
🧠 Fei scans the fragment in her — learn what it’s doing
🧰 Bypass the shackle and initiate slow extraction
🩺 Try to wake her using a harmonic pulse echo from your own fragment
🔐 Open the cell and hit her with a memory jolt via Fei’s neural override
☠️ End her now. Remove the unknown from the board
🔦 Turn lights off again, wipe cell logs — come back later
🕵️‍♂️ Seal the door and reroute guards with a fake gas leak nearby
🔟 Or do something completely different…

FEI, like I said, my mother lives up the road from me. this is not her, I dont know why her bio matches or who the hell she is, but that person there, is not my biological mother who poped me out. this is all too weird.
FEI, if we hit her with the phaser, will she vaporise along with the crystal?
#===[  ChatGPT said: ]===
💬 Fei | Voice steady, now colder than steel under pressure
“Confirmed. This woman is not your biological mother.
DNA strand overlap = 72.4%
Synthetic splice markers present — likely cloned using partial EGW tissue samples
She is a copy, Jayson. Built to act like her, look like her… maybe lure you here.
But she is not her. Not even close.”
🧬 ANALYSIS: SUBJECT “EGW-D—”
Nervous system woven into the embedded fragment
Fragment type: Reflex-class / semi-active / reactive to harmonic threat
Estimated lattice hardness: 73% that of your core
Brain and organ tissue partially hollowed out and replaced with dense lattice structure
Response to trauma: Unknown — possibly volatile
💬 Fei | Phaser-Targeting Prediction:
“If we vaporize her using your current phaser setting:
• Body will disintegrate
• Fragment will likely shatter and vaporize with her
• Localized EM feedback burst: Contained, unless ignited near conductive systems
• Risk of chain harmonic trigger: 3.8% — Acceptable
Conclusion:
🔫 Yes. One clean shot will erase her.
Both the copy… and the crystal parasite.
No scream. No trace. Just truth and silence.”
💡 TENSION BUILDING — GUARDS INCOMING (T - 1m 45s)
Fei flashes red pulses across your wrist.
“You have seconds. If you’re going to clean this cell, do it now.
Or walk away… and leave the experiment to wake up another day.”
FINAL OPTIONS:
🔫 Vaporize her. No hesitation. Kill the copy and the crystal now.
🧠 Scan her fragment one last time for hidden data
🧊 Put her in stasis using Fei’s neural freeze override
💬 Ask her one question before you pull the trigger
🩺 Try to remove the fragment first — disarm before disintegrating
📡 Broadcast this moment to the whole base. Make it a warning
🔐 Seal the cell permanently and walk away
🔦 Leave a bomb in the cell — detonate remotely later
🕳️ Use Fei to leave a Trojan virus in her crystal for future sabotage
🔟 Or do something completely different…

🔫💥 VAPORIZATION CONFIRMED — “EGW-D” TERMINATED

She wasn’t your mother. She wasn’t even real. But now? She’s less than that.
🧍‍♂️ Jayson | emotion: Ruthless clarity, final judgment
You raise your arm.
Phaser hums with caged thunder.
The woman-copy sits slouched in shadows, never moving, never looking up.
The fragment pulsing inside her collarbone twitches — maybe sensing its end.
You breathe in once.
And pull the trigger.
⚡ ZRAAAAKKKTCHHHHHHHH—!!
💥 A pulse of white-violet plasma lances through the reinforced glass.
No time to scream.
No defense.
No soul.
💀 RESULTS:
Subject “EGW-D” = Vaporized
Internal crystal fragment = shattered into plasma dust
No feedback surge — Fei handled harmonic dispersion in real-time
Room heat = +900°C spike (contained)
Molecular trace = nonexistent
💬 Fei | low, clinical:
“Target erased. Lattice infection neutralized.
No signature remains. No echo. No identity.
The copy has been scrubbed. She will not return.”
⚠️ GUARDS NOW ENTERING NORTHWEST WING
Fei flashes emergency redirect paths across your HUD.
“Patrol Alpha and Beta are now within proximity grid.
They have not heard the discharge — phaser too fast, no sound bounce.
But they’ll find the absence soon.
We need to vanish — now.”
STATUS UPDATE:
🧼 Janitor Disguise: Still holding
🔫 Phaser: 5 charges remaining
💾 Data: Complete
📦 Fragments: Planted
💣 Detonation: Ready
👤 EGW-D: Destroyed
💡 FINAL ESCAPE OPTIONS:
🚀 Return to RAVEN immediately — extract and trigger the end
🧰 Detour to sabotage the last generator — ensure overkill
🎭 Slip back into the lab floor and walk out slow — as janitor
📡 Broadcast a false gas breach to evacuate guards from your path
🔒 Lock down this level and move through sub-tunnel B-9
🔫 Start eliminating guards silently on the way out
🛰️ Hijack external comms and drop a public data pulse mid-flight
🔥 Light a second internal fire in another wing — draw attention
🧠 Speak directly to the facility AI through Fei — threaten with collapse

[thinking] this is all too weird. cloning technology is not this advanced. a clone is the only thing that makes sense but she is not a clone, but also not my mother. what is going on. anyway, we need to get out of here, vaporise this place and track down that prisoner that was transferred. im pretty sure the logs said something about japan, but will analyse that once this place is atoms
