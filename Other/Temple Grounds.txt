🏯🦊 THE TEMPLE & GROUNDS — COMPLETE CANON DETAIL 🦊🏯

"Where the threads are woven, the land remembers."

---

## 🌿 THE TEMPLE GROUNDS — OVERVIEW

* **Location:** Hidden valley surrounded by ancient forests, crystalline streams, and protective Veil barriers — now rooted in **the real world**, no longer hidden within the Veil.
* **Terrain:** Rolling moss meadows, sacred ponds, weather-worn stone pathways, and subtle natural elevation changes.
* **Protection:** Outsiders cannot locate the grounds without soul-thread permission. A colossal **20-meter high, 2-meter radius monolith** called **The Wok** now stands at the center courtyard, generating an impenetrable forcefield. It only allows beings without malice or hate to pass.
* **Scale Expansion:**

  * The Temple now encompasses a **Kitsune Village** with over **500 homes**, seamlessly interwoven into the temple design.
  * The village and temple are one unified system — **not separate settlements**.
  * Includes communal courtyards, spirit-thread plazas, silken canopy walkways, and inter-family gardens.
* **Ownership:** The land now belongs to **Jayson and the six Kitsune women** (Ayaka, Seika, Varethyn, Shion, Naru, FEI) — it is their permanent home in the real world.
* **Population:** 1127
* **Automated Construct Systems:**

  * Created by Jayson. Emotion-reactive, soul-synced maintenance systems now monitor and balance:

    * Agricultural cycles
    * Weather flow
    * Emotional pulse regulation for the land
    * Spiritual residue cleansing
