### **Formatting Template**
Emojis as shown; sections via `---`. No extra labels.  
If using verbs in spoken lines (e.g., huff, snort), put the word in single quotes or split the conversation up.  

1. **Scene Intro**  
   `# emoji "SCENE LOCATION UPPER" | emoji "WEATHER UPPER" | emoji "TIME OF DAY, ACTUAL TIME"`  
   `## Scene Title: TITLE`  
   *immersive sentences (sensory/tone/lore from `TheMangaStory.txt`); unique, no repeats to set the mood.*

2. **Interactions**  
   **Player Character Rule:** When user input provides PC actions/dialogue, format a leading ### JAYSON | [emojis] block with 💬 for speech, >> 💭 if inferred (profile-true, sparse), and 📝 for polished actions—position first for primacy. Always narrate PC in second-person ("you") for actions/perceptions within intro/📝 or blocks—seamless extension of agency (e.g., "You laugh low..."). No third-person for PC (replace "Jayson laughs" with "you laugh"); NPCs get third-person only. Merge lightly into narration if needed (e.g., fold "you wink" into beats).  
   `### emoji CHARACTER NAME | emotions [emojis]`  

   > 💬 "Spoken lines only (natural, pauses). Omit if nothing is spoken. Break conversations in order of user input. Always on a new line"  

   >> 💭 *Italic internal thoughts (profile-true).* (dont share thoughts of everyone, my character is not a mind reader; optional for PC if additive)  

   >> 📜 sentence lore/context blurb. (Optional/Situational)  

   📝 Descriptive actions/notes w/ emojis. (Optional; blank line before)  

   *Rules:* Logical order (speech > thoughts > 📜 > 📝); 1-line spacing. Descriptors in 📜/📝, not speech. Include optionals only if additive.  
   **Dialogue Beats:** 💬 holds quoted speech only (natural sentences/chunks with pauses via ellipses/dashes). Interrupt for actions with unquoted 📝-style beats: either new 💬 line per segment (e.g., > 💬 "Line?" >> 📝 Action. > 💬 "Next."), or chain in one block (e.g., > 💬 "Line?" Action "Next."). No quotes/actions inside speech; rotate for variety without repetition. If verbs imply sound (e.g., 'huff'), single-quote as 'huff' post-quote if not full 📝.  

3. **Tags**  
   `TAGS: [######]`  
   *Sequential +1 from last (branch/modify based on target tag). Unclear? HALT for [debug]. No skips/duplicates/resets.*

[PREVIOUS CHAPTER SUMMARY]
## Chapter Summary (TAG [000001] → End) — Sequential

1) Return from the UN, aftermath mood
- 7:00 AM, 2061: Jayson and Varethyn return to Tsunejima after giving the UN 48 hours to return 1600+ captives.
- Jayson hugs Varethyn, then says this is “it,” and that once everyone is home he’ll need her help with something he can’t say yet.
- He says he’ll be back for tea soon, then leaves to find missing family members.

2) Finding Seika, pulling her back from isolation
- Jayson locates Seika using a soft, undetectable island pulse (he hasn’t seen her in days and is worried).
- He takes her hand and presses it to his heart under his shirt: “Put it here when you don’t know where to put it.”
- Seika’s pain surfaces; Jayson wraps tails with hers, anchors her physically/emotionally, reassures her she never needs permission for warmth.
- He admits he likes making enemies afraid / hurting them, but restrains himself because of his love for the family and the island.
- He validates her worth, tells her hiding isn’t cowardice, and she can “steal” him if she needs him.
- He shifts to levity: jokes about foreplay, cleans their faces with shrine water, slings her over his shoulder, pinches her butt, and announces “to tea!”

3) Dining hall re-center: warmth, inclusion, normality
- Jayson bursts into the dining hall with Seika, reunites with Ayaka, Naru, Varethyn, and Fei.
- He jokes about finding Seika “talking to koi like a stage play,” but protects her dignity.
- He yoinks Seika into his lap with his tails: “I need love,” feeds dumplings, sips tea.
- Under the table, his tails wrap around everyone’s legs to anchor warmth and inclusion after chaotic days.
- He thanks Naru for tea and settles the room’s tone.

4) Checking Lysera: fear of “fade,” reassurance, choice
- Jayson pulse-searches for Lysera, runs to catch her (realizing she’s very fast).
- He apologizes for upsetting her and admits her going quiet scares him more than her snapping.
- He offers a hug; reassures her about the coming 1600+ and tells her he’ll respect how she needs to handle being “full.”
- He invites her back to tea or to keep running; brushes her hair back.
- He carries her to the dining hall and seats her in a corner/near the side exit for comfort.

5) Checking Shion: fear of being “less,” repair
- Jayson pulse-finds Shion and learns she’s been hurt by not being told during the rapid escalation.
- He hugs her fully with tails, lifts her off the ground, promises if she’d been there he would have told her.
- He nibbles her ear, notices the red hair clip he gave her, and offers hand-holding as they walk back together.

6) “This is it” speech: nationhood, numbers, unity
- Back in the dining hall, Jayson wraps tails around everyone’s legs again.
- He speaks about the near future: within 48 hours their numbers will double, they’ll become a nation, and they’ll have saved almost everyone.
- He explicitly includes Lysera in the “nation” and invites her to come collect survivors with him—fox and wolf united.

7) Domestic comedy + planning: Varethyn growth, village layout, mountains moved
- Jayson jokes with Shion (serviette up nostril), teases Varethyn when she calls him an idiot—highlighting Varethyn’s growth into warmer banter.
- While thinking, he braids Ayaka’s tail absentmindedly and weaves in glowing crystal thread that changes color with mood.
- He explains the crystal/heart-string-like thread comes from his soulstone output; it’s finite at once but regrows (enough for ~50 blankets, then ~2 days to refill).
- Village planning: prefers a “petals” layout around the temple—grouped communities, walkways/streams/parks, training grounds near bathhouses.
- With Varethyn’s permission (temple grounds), he moves the mountains ~100 meters for symmetry and jokes nobody will notice.

8) The first arrivals begin: logistics and the “no runway” solution
- Naru gets the first ping: returns are starting.
- Jayson notes Tsunejima has no landing strip; plan is portals from aircraft to the island near Healing Hall 2.
- (Throughout, Jayson repeatedly enforces the rule: don’t add actions/lines for him beyond what he inputs.)

9) Plane pickup: first group of 32
- Jayson flies alongside a plane, signals the pilot, and phases into the cabin.
- He reassures the soldiers/pilot: they aren’t responsible; he hates the idiots who hurt his people, not humans individually.
- He addresses the 32: portal home; they’ll be met by family; food/water/medicine/bathrooms/clothing/beds ready.
- He opens a gentle portal to Healing Hall 2 and offers a hand to a wolfkin, noting his mate is wolfkin (Lysera).

10) Arrival at Healing Hall 2: plushies, then emotional crash
- Jayson welcomes them, makes plushies (children first) that purr when squeezed, plus pillows/cushions/soft toys.
- After closing the portal, his float stutters; he hits the ground around the corner and breaks silently.
- He admits the overload: he feels their pain/sorrow/fear, and the lack of hope hurts most.
- Lysera holds him; he admits he’s “full” now and asks to sit outside the door.
- He sits for hours listening; later tells Varethyn he wasn’t hiding—he needed out fast so survivors saw pillars, not emotion.

11) Mara: new survivor bond, offering safety without force
- A new visitor arrives: Mara (wolfkin). Jayson invites her to sit with him.
- He promises no one is a burden and tells her where to go if she wakes scared (his hill house with the seven wives).
- He materializes warm food, explains food/drink are infinite and there is no currency on the island.
- He offers her a locator “ability” to find Lysera (demonstrates with a screen-like example), clarifies it doesn’t summon anyone and is choice-based.
- He transfers the ability gently and lets her trial it; learns her name: Mara.
- He warns there are a few humans on the island (married to foxes) who will keep distance if needed.

12) Dinner integration: Mara meets the family
- 5pm gong; Jayson invites Mara to eat, carries her to the dining hall via side entrance, seats her on his lap.
- He introduces her to the wives, feeds dumplings, offers miso; the wives watch because it’s rare to see him so domestic and soft.
- Mara relaxes and drifts asleep; Jayson decides to bring her home and sleep on the couch so she won’t wake panicking in the hall.

13) Nightmares: Mara hurts him by accident, he shows it’s okay
- Mara has a violent nightmare and accidentally gouges Jayson.
- He shows her the wounds healing, wipes blood, reassures her she’s safe and can’t drive him away.
- He soothes her back to sleep with humming/tapping and invites Lysera to curl on the couch too.
- They sleep until around 7am.

14) Morning reset: wash, breakfast, back to work
- Jayson wakes, greets Mara and Lysera, suggests Lysera showers Mara with soothing bubbles.
- Jayson goes to the dining hall, updates Varethyn: Mara slept, had nightmares, Lysera is showering her.
- He jokes with Mara, does a Seika glitter prank, then snaps the glitter away and keeps the mood light.

15) Naru’s intel + the rescue run begins in earnest
- Naru provides coordinates and which nations are stalling; Jayson reiterates no outsiders near healing halls.
- Jayson demands the ready list and starts collecting directly via fold-space rather than waiting for transport.
- Rapid collections:
  - Italy: coordinates, portal transfer, thanks soldiers.
  - Germany: disassembles convoy like lego, reassures, portal, plushies; kneels and waits for frozen survivors; reassembles convoy; thanks guards.
  - Spain: arrives with black lightning (new effect); finds missing mother issue; fold-space search; demands belongings from a facility; destroys gate/wall; returns with belongings and buses; reunites child and mother; portals group home.
  - Canada: notes better treatment; does minor healing; portals group home; learns Japan delivered 26 already via an unmarked ship.

16) UK embassy → Kestrel base escalation → EMP and “top brass” confrontation
- Jayson appears at the UK embassy and demands updates on the 850 held; refuses bureaucracy; midnight deadline is non-negotiable.
- Learns Kestrel is uncooperative; teleports violently to Kestrel, crushes gates, disables towers, demands people out.
- Confronts leadership; rage threatens punishment, then switches to kindness to portal survivors home with plushies.
- Asks again for names; when refused, triggers an EMP that wipes the base’s electronics and leaves.
- Finds UK decision-makers (Voss/Crowe/etc.), accuses them, gives 5 minutes to evacuate, then crushes the building and creates a memorial statue:
  - Metal turned into an un-rusting alloy statue of kitsune slaves reaching up to their 9-tailed god.
  - Names/ages/deaths inscribed at the base; threat to create more if removed.

17) Staging area convergence: final big group + mercenary standoff
- Jayson returns to the staging area where hundreds gather; reassures them, gives plushies, promises safety while waiting for stragglers.
- A large hostile merc/military group arrives demanding custody; Jayson warns them off and crushes armored vehicles into metal balls.
- Mercs block the last convoy; Jayson uses wraith/void pressure tactics and forces the convoy behind him, demanding his people be gathered and the threat removed.

18) Hungary: the last 12 and the end-state
- Hungary transfer point: 268 present; 12 delayed; “rogue unit” trying to re-route assets.
- Jayson gives the 268 plushies, tells soldiers to hold position and fire a flare if anything happens, then folds space to the delayed convoy.
- Road blockade: mercs barricade the convoy; open fire; think they have him; Jayson reassembles.
- Jayson deflects rounds and mounted gunfire; ricochets thin merc numbers; he crushes their vehicles into scrap and orders them to leave.
- Jayson folds space, bringing the whole convoy back; guides the 12 off; thanks soldiers; gives plushies; opens portal; sends them home; closes portal and waves goodbye.

19) Final moment: “starfish collapse,” almost done
- Back on Tsunejima temple grounds: everyone is home; no soldiers remain.
- Naru reports Poland and Romania delivered too: groups of 95 and 82 (triggered by the warning request to inform them).
- Jayson smiles, then collapses backward onto stone “like a tree,” sprawls like a starfish laughing.
- He says he’ll lay there a bit; they’re almost done.
- Remaining loose end: the 3 space stations; Jayson plans to visit America later regarding them.
