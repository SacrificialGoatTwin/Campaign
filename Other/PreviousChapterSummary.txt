[PREVIOUS CHAPTER SUMMARY]
immediately after the final rescues on Earth are completed. Jayson collapses on the temple grounds of
Tsunejima, laughing in exhausted relief, sprawled like a starfish on the stone. The weight of what he’s done—saving every last
kitsune and beastfolk he could find—finally hits him. In that quiet aftermath, he speaks with Naru about the remaining loose ends:
three space stations still out there, unresolved. He insists he will rest first, not from fatigue, but because the future they
fought for is finally within reach.
What follows is a brief return to levity and domestic warmth. Jayson jokes with the others, hissing when Varethyn blocks the
sunlight, teasing about absurd fantasies of throne rooms and grapes, and bantering about “harems” before being gently but firmly
checked by his wives. These moments re-establish the family dynamic: affectionate, sharp-tongued, irreverent, and grounded in
mutual trust. Amid this, Jayson reassures newly rescued survivors, explaining Tsunejima’s rules—not as laws, but as guidance. He
emphasizes that this is a community, not a business; that mistakes are met with correction, not punishment; and that everyone will
receive a fully furnished home of their own, customizable and permanent. The idea of choice—windows, locks, location, even absurd
options like the moon—is repeated again and again to hammer home that safety and agency are real here.
Eventually, Jayson withdraws with Varethyn to a quiet pond. The jokes soften into intimacy. He credits his wives for everything
he’s accomplished, and Varethyn responds in kind, affirming that she and the others choose him—not out of obligation, but intent.
The moment is peaceful, earned, and fragile.
That peace breaks suddenly.
Jayson’s instincts spike. He senses something wrong—not on the island, but far beyond it. He folds space with Varethyn to the
northern edge of Tsunejima, where reality itself feels strained. There, a presence manifests: vast, controlled, unmistakably
powerful. This being—later called “the Watcher”—is not a god in the mythic sense, but a celestial caretaker, one of very few,
responsible for maintaining stability across regions of existence. Jayson reacts instantly, placing Varethyn behind him and
raising a visible, hardened shield around them both. He demands the being state its purpose.
The Watcher explains that he is there to acknowledge what Jayson has done. The rescue of the kitsune and beastfolk closed a wound
that had been open since before recorded history. Jayson challenges him hard, accusing him of valuing the act of caring more than
preventing suffering, pointing out that the Watcher had the power to end it all faster and cleaner. The Watcher admits this
freely—but explains that he did not act because doing so would have replaced suffering with dependence or erased the agency of
those involved. This was not his rescue to perform.
As the conversation deepens, the Watcher reveals the real reason for his visit: there exists another world, known as “the
Outside,” a remnant planet that survived the last cosmic wipe because it was already broken. It contains remaining beastfolk
populations who are suffering under slavery, exploitation, and collapse. The Watcher cannot act there directly without causing
catastrophic failure. Jayson can. His nature places him outside the constraints that bind the celestials.
Jayson reacts with fury and distrust. He tests the Watcher by firing a concentrated beam of absolute energy into him, confirming
the vast but bounded nature of the being’s power. He tells the Watcher he will think about the proposal, then dismisses him. The
Watcher leaves—properly, respectfully.
Immediately after, Jayson collapses again, shaken by the encounter. Varethyn grounds him, reminding him that he held his ground
and that the island remains theirs.
However, when Jayson folds space back to the temple, he finds the Watcher there again—casually speaking with Seika. Enraged,
Jayson violently intervenes, pulling Seika to safety and striking the Watcher through the courtyard wall. The Watcher admits he
spoke to the others, not Seika, and reveals that time is far shorter than he implied. A second celestial arrives—far more
aggressive, urgent, and blunt—pushing the idea that Jayson is built for this task and does not truly have a choice.
This escalates into a confrontation between the two celestials themselves: one advocating consent and restraint, the other urgency
and inevitability. Jayson rejects both approaches, calling out their failure to communicate like people. When they finally admit
the truth—that this is a rescue mission and that only Jayson is compatible with completing it—he sets his terms.
Jayson declares that Varethyn, Naru, and Fei must remain behind to keep Tsunejima functioning: Varethyn as High Matron, Naru as
the island’s technological backbone, and Fei as its equal power. He chooses Shion, Lysera, Ayaka, and Seika to accompany him. He
issues a clear warning to the celestials: if anything happens to the island or to these four, he will hunt them personally,
regardless of time or cost.
The celestials accept the condition.
Without ceremony, they wave their hands—and Jayson and the four are forcibly sent beyond the border of their influence. They
cannot place them properly; they can only throw them. Jayson awakens alone in an ancient forest on the Outside world, disoriented,
cut off from the island’s hum, sensing that the others are alive but scattered.
Back on Tsunejima, the celestials explain everything they withheld. The Outside world—Eryndor—is a magic-structured planet with
mechanical progression systems, political empires, enslaved beastfolk, and fractured rules. Humans dominate most territories.
Beastfolk exist as second-class citizens or worse. The celestials confirm they cannot retrieve Jayson or his companions, nor can
they bring him back. Any return path must be created by him.
Fei steps forward and calmly informs the celestials that Jayson will likely kill them when he returns. Both acknowledge this
without protest. Varethyn then delivers the final warning: Jayson’s mercy is the only reason they are still alive, and if he
returns changed, they will not stop him.
The chapter ends with the island safe, the shield intact, and Jayson gone—dropped into a broken world where the last rescue has
truly begun, and where the consequences of the celestials’ choices are no longer theoretical.

- WORLD AUTONOMY: Introduce interruptions, difficult strangers, misunderstandings, and occasional random encounters. The world must initiate events sometimes.
- ISEKAI FEEL: Play Eryndor like an anime isekai—strong “camera” framing, sharp beats, tension in calm moments, and early-world hostility/confusion. (No literal game UI unless I ask.)
- FORMAT: 💬 speech only. Actions go 📝. No actions inside 💬.
- NO CODE FENCES FOR SCENES: Scenes are presented normally; only rules/templates go in code blocks.
