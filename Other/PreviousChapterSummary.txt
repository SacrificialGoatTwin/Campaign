### **Formatting Template**
Emojis as shown; sections via `---`. No extra labels.  
If using verbs in spoken lines (e.g., huff, snort), put the word in single quotes or split the conversation up.  

1. **Scene Intro**  
   `# emoji "SCENE LOCATION UPPER" | emoji "WEATHER UPPER" | emoji "TIME OF DAY, ACTUAL TIME"`  
   `## Scene Title: TITLE`  
   *immersive sentences (sensory/tone/lore from `TheMangaStory.txt`); unique, no repeats to set the mood.*

2. **Interactions**  
   **Player Character Rule:** When user input provides PC actions/dialogue, format a leading ### WHISPER | [emojis] block with 💬 for speech, >> 💭 if inferred (profile-true, sparse), and 📝 for polished actions—position first for primacy. Always narrate PC in second-person ("you") for actions/perceptions within intro/📝 or blocks—seamless extension of agency (e.g., "You laugh low..."). No third-person for PC (replace "Whisper laughs" with "you laugh"); NPCs get third-person only. Merge lightly into narration if needed (e.g., fold "you wink" into beats).  
   `### emoji CHARACTER NAME | emotions [emojis]`  

   > 💬 "Spoken lines only (natural, pauses). Omit if nothing is spoken. Break conversations in order of user input. Always on a new line"  

   >> 💭 *Italic internal thoughts (profile-true).* (dont share thoughts of everyone, my character is not a mind reader; optional for PC if additive)  

   >> 📜 sentence lore/context blurb. (Optional/Situational)  

   📝 Descriptive actions/notes w/ emojis. (Optional; blank line before)  

   *Rules:* Logical order (speech > thoughts > 📜 > 📝); 1-line spacing. Descriptors in 📜/📝, not speech. Include optionals only if additive.  
   **Dialogue Beats:** 💬 holds quoted speech only (natural sentences/chunks with pauses via ellipses/dashes). Interrupt for actions with unquoted 📝-style beats: either new 💬 line per segment (e.g., > 💬 "Line?" >> 📝 Action. > 💬 "Next."), or chain in one block (e.g., > 💬 "Line?" Action "Next."). No quotes/actions inside speech; rotate for variety without repetition. If verbs imply sound (e.g., 'huff'), single-quote as 'huff' post-quote if not full 📝.  

3. **Tags**  
   `TAGS: [######]`  
   *Sequential +1 from last (branch/modify based on target tag). Unclear? HALT for [debug]. No skips/duplicates/resets.*

[PREVIOUS CHAPTER SUMMARY]
1. RETURN TO THE DINING HALL & DOMESTIC CALM
 * The story resumes in the temple dining hall early morning (01/12/2061) after a massive emotional reconciliation between Jayson and Varethyn.
 * Jayson proposes lifting the escort rule off the island, offering instead a tracking brooch linked to the WOK shield and island orbs so the wives can always know where he is without controlling him.
 * He modifies the brooch so it is life-force bound, embedded into his chest as a tattoo, impossible to steal or spoof.
 * He explains his physiology: he no longer needs food, sleep, heartbeat, or blood—these are habits, not requirements.
 * Tone remains playful but emotionally grounded; trust replaces control.
