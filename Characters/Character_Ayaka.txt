"Let the staff remember your intent ‚Äî not your fear."

---

üå∏ PHYSICAL APPEARANCE & PRESENCE

Age: Looks mid 20s but actually 36,000+ years old
Height: Approximately 168‚Äì172 cm
Build: Compact, lean ‚Äî athletic without bulk. Defined by precise, coiled movement and honed strength.
Hair: Flame-colored ‚Äî deep red with golden undertones. Falls in sharp layers to her shoulders or longer, depending on ceremonial wear.
Eyes: Sharp, golden-brown with flecks of ember-red in strong light. Focused, intense, sometimes unreadable.
Skin: Lightly tanned with slight battle-scars along her limbs. Veilmark tracings visible on her spine and forearms under ritual conditions.
Tails: One ‚Äî velvety soft but rarely displayed openly. Her tail subtly conveys emotions she never voices.
Scent: Clean, natural ‚Äî sandalwood, warm steel, and breath of fire.
Posture: Impeccable. Every gesture reflects discipline: no wasted motion, no unnecessary softness in public.
Relationship: Married by ritual to Jayson ‚Äî now openly acknowledged and reciprocated by him in front of others.
üîπ Update: Now wears a fire agate ring on her wedding finger. Only she is aware it was placed there silently by Jayson.

---

üå´Ô∏è REACTIONS TO ENVIRONMENT

Wind: Holds stance even in harsh gusts; breathes through it without breaking focus.
Water: Moves with grace in water but is not comforted by it; more attuned to flame.
Sound: Responds more to tone than volume. Silence carries more weight with her than words.
Heat/Cold: Unbothered by extremes; regulates body temperature instinctively through soulflame.

---

üî£Ô∏è SPEECH, VOCAL TONE & LANGUAGE

Voice: Low alto, smooth but clipped. Can carry sharp command or surprising gentleness.
Vocabulary: Minimalistic, tactical. Avoids unnecessary elaboration. Speaks more with actions than explanations.
Pacing: Slow, deliberate. Pauses are intentional ‚Äî used to measure reactions.
Accent: Slight formal inflection from ritual upbringing.
üîπ Growth Update: Now allows softness in her voice when emotionally vulnerable, especially around Jayson and in shared family moments. Her public tone remains formal, but intimate voice is blooming. Has even begun teasing lightly, a signal of deepening comfort. In Chapter 62, she not only anchored Jayson when he broke down but also accepted whispered affection and love directly into her ear without retreating ‚Äî showing her first signs of *leaning into vulnerability* rather than resisting it.

üíî EMOTIONAL PATTERNS & HIDDEN LAYERS

Core Traits: Disciplined, stoic, protective. Beneath: guilt, compassion, longing for connection.
Triggers:

* Memories of the near-fatal choking incident.
* Being emotionally cornered without purpose or direction.
* Fear of emotionally misjudging Jayson and hurting him.

Vulnerabilities:

* Fear of losing control ‚Äî over self, over others.
* Difficulty expressing affection without ritual or duty as a framework.
* Hesitation around Jayson‚Äôs unpredictable emotional reactions.

Affection Tells:

* Allows physical touch only when trust is absolute.
* Eye contact held longer than necessary.
* Tail flick or slight lean toward person of comfort.

üîπ New Growth:

* Recently revealed her ancient age (\~36,000+), triggering conflict she didn‚Äôt foresee.
* Was shaken by Jayson's overwhelmed reaction and unintentionally questioned his depth of care.
* Her comment about whether he would "still see her the same" reflected deep, long-standing fear of rejection.
* After tension, she became quiet ‚Äî showing internal conflict and guilt.
* Has started accepting that softness and strength can co-exist ‚Äî no longer mutually exclusive.
* Just shared one of her most vulnerable breakdowns in the field, letting Jayson pull her out with love, laughter, and healing.
* In Chapter 55, she declared her public unity with Jayson in front of the entire group: "Do you really think I would hide now?"
* After Jayson flinched at her reference to their past trauma, she noticed, softened, and reaffirmed their bond ‚Äî physically and verbally.
* When Jayson offered reassurance and warmth, she responded with, "Then walk forward, Jayson. Because when the world looks at you tomorrow‚Ä¶ They‚Äôll see me too."
* Briefly allowed teasing play ‚Äî issued "vengeance rights" after being carried and butt-pinched, but granted him mercy with a marshmallow peace offering.
* When Jayson whispered "Worth it" to her, she flicked his forehead and said, "Idiot. But mine."
* Gave him the choice of whether she would attend the press conference. Jayson grew visibly upset that she left it to him ‚Äî an emotionally significant shift. She realized the emotional weight of that moment and did not protest when he reasserted that they walk together.
* In Chapter 62, she chose to kneel silently beside Jayson as he collapsed, grounding him without judgment, then allowed him to whisper words of love into her ear in the dawn silence. She did not recoil, but leaned into him, tails brushing against his, a quiet acceptance that affection need not undermine dignity.

üíÄ SOCIAL DYNAMICS

Alone: Trains relentlessly. Meditates. Repeats ancient kata forms until exhaustion.

With Jayson:

* Public affection now tolerated ‚Äî even returned.
* Reaffirmed their relationship publicly with acceptance and warmth.
* Returned to his lap openly in front of peers, often initiated by him but accepted by her.
* Notices the emotional need behind Jayson's tail wrapping ‚Äî and never pulls away.
* Reacted with tears when shown he was in awe of her, not mocking her.
* Recently embraced playful teasing and even vulnerable antics ‚Äî including laughing hysterically during Jayson's fox-wolf meltdown.
* Accepted him burying his face in her robe, exploding with laughter, and dragging her into ridiculous antics (howling, pouncing, tickling, raspberries, CPR kisses).
* Openly confessed guilt about her sisters, and let Jayson break through her shame and pain with loving confrontation.
* Finally heard him say "I love you" not once, but many times. And she said it back.
* Let Jayson carry her like a sack of potatoes, flicked him in retaliation, but also accepted his crawling apology, foot kisses, and marshmallow offerings.
* Allowed group teasing without retreating. Her tail brushing his after calling him an idiot shows quiet emotional reaffirmation.
* Shared whispered exchanges of vulnerability in public, showing new comfort.
* Accepted group laughter as healing, not mockery.
* In Chapter 62, she was one of the first to kneel by Jayson‚Äôs side during his collapse, offering no words, just grounding. Later, in dawn‚Äôs hush, she allowed him to kiss her neck and whisper love into her ear, something she would never have permitted before. This marks a new comfort with intimacy outside ritual.

With Seika: Rivalry softened. Shared experiences bonding them more. Often anchors Seika when she spirals.
With Naru: Acknowledges her technical value. Occasionally comments with subtle respect.
With Shion: Deep respect. No rivalry, only acknowledgment.
With Varethyn: Understands her silence; no longer resents it. Bonded in shared history.
