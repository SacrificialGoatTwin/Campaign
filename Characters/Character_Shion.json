Her honesty wounded Jayson, and joining in the roof accusation cut him further — yet it proves her courage to face truths, even when they fracture bonds. At the gorge, she became the one entrusted with his failsafes, and post-council she showed presence instead of prosecution, proving she is more than the blade: she is anchor, lover, and mirror. In the latest chapter, her restraint, empathetic silence, and calm de-escalation during Jayson's shielded breakdown show a new maturity: she can be a stabilizer, not just a sentinel."
