After Ch305–306, she admitted her fault, dropped her mantle fully, and vowed never again to wound Jayson with fear disguised as judgment. Council night reaffirmed her as institution-builder: terms set, record kept, autonomy respected — even when it hurt. The courtyard incident pushed this further: confronted with the fact that her instinctive use of power could make him feel unsafe in her presence, she chose contrition, clear boundaries around touch, and quiet, non-invasive presence at his back rather than retreat or command, marking a new phase in how she loves someone who is both godfire and deeply breakable. The shrine confrontation and the ridiculous, tender breakfast that followed drove the lesson deeper: when she nearly lost him, she chose to show fear instead of power, to be held instead of enthroned, and to sit at his side the next morning while he turned her into the flustered heart of the foxpile’s laughter — and discovered she wanted that far more than the safety of distance."
