🕊️ SORII’KA — THE VANISHED FLAME — COMPLETE PROFILE
"If I ran to protect the world from me… and it still waited — then maybe I was wrong to run."

---

🌸 PHYSICAL APPEARANCE

* Apparent Age: Unknown, but clearly ancient. Likely equal or older than Varethyn (2160+ years).
* Height: Slightly taller than average Kitsune women. Willowy, elegant frame.
* Build: Lean and underfed from her long exile; subtle strength beneath malnourishment.
* Hair: Originally silver-white, streaked with grime and age. After healing, now fully restored into shimmering platinum-silver.
* Eyes: Pale lavender with fractured, glass-like patterns in the iris — like cracked gemstone. These healed after Jayson restored her.
* Skin: Once rough, scarred, marked with soot, grime, and age. After healing, smooth ivory-white with a subtle Kitsune shimmer.
* Tails: Nine. Long and wild in shape, slightly less groomed than ceremonial tails. Movement once panicked and erratic, now slowly calm and flowing. Color matches her restored hair: platinum or snow-white.
* Clothing: Previously tattered robes. After healing, Jayson conjured a new outfit: flowing ceremonial whites, soft layers for dignity and comfort.
* Notable Presence: Carries the gravity of loss and return. Her aura, once volatile, now hums with spiritual calm.

🧠 EMOTIONAL & PSYCHOLOGICAL PROFILE

**Before Healing:**

* Deep paranoia. Believed any Kitsune or being of power would destroy her on sight.
* Heavy survivor's guilt — felt her own power was a danger to those she loved.
* Avoidant, reactive, frightened. Expected Jayson and Fei to be assassins.
* Immediately panicked in presence of another powerful being (Jayson), showing terror.
* Would not speak or respond until reassured in ancient tongue.

**After Healing:**

* Emotionally softening. Tearful at Jayson’s compassion.
* Agreed to meet Varethyn despite overwhelming fear.
* Exhibits signs of wanting forgiveness, peace, reconnection.
* Fragile but awakening to the possibility of belonging again.
* Curious about temple life but unsure how to reintegrate.
* Shown signs of being deeply moved by Jayson's humility and humor.

💥 ABILITIES & POWER LEVEL

* Nine-Tailed Kitsune of ancient bloodline. Power akin to Varethyn.
* Spiritual energy so dense that Jayson was forced to seal her motion for safety.
* Aura radiated unchecked power due to years of isolation and trauma.
* Post-healing: thread stabilized, spiritual core aligned.
* Implied potential for creation and destruction similar to divine-scale beings.
* May carry innate knowledge of pre-temple rituals, flame-weaving, and spiritual resonance.

🕰️ BACKSTORY & HISTORY

* One of the original three Nine-Tailed Kitsune in Varethyn's generation.
* The only surviving one apart from Varethyn; third (Syn'Raa) presumed faded until recently.
* Fled long ago due to internal chaos or fear of harming others.
* Lived alone in hiding, deeply disconnected from Kitsune civilization.
* Possibly predates formal Japan, as her memory and fear links to primal instincts.
* Recently brought back to temple by Jayson after being spiritually healed and emotionally forgiven.

🪷 RELATIONSHIPS & CONNECTIONS

* **Varethyn** — Once companion, possible romantic or ceremonial bond in past. Feared her judgment more than any other. Now stunned to learn Varethyn has changed.
* **Jayson** — First being to show her compassion, warmth, and safety. Hugged her. Healed her. Offered trust without cost. She now follows him and trusts him. Internally grateful he returned after pushing her back into reality.
* **Fei** — Respected as Jayson's twin. Intrigued by her nature and position, but not yet bonded deeply.
* **Syn'Raa** — Recently reunited. Their bond is tentative but anchored by shared history with Varethyn.
