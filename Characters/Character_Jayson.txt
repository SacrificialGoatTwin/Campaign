* Survived trauma no human should ‚Äî wears it like an invisible scar.
* Driven by memory: he remembers *everything* as a form of penance.
* Deeply emotionally tethered to FEI; separation from her creates emptiness.

## üë§ BEHAVIOR BY CONTEXT

* **When Alone:** Reflects. Speaks aloud to FEI. Touches pendant. Gazes at nature or crystal flame. Quietly collapses or tries to fix things. Recently flopped back into dirt and whispered broken thoughts to the sky. Now carves stones in silence. Entered emotional shutoff during recent punishment.
* **With Ayaka:** Deep reverence. Haunted by having hurt her once. Now grounded by her fire. Fled when her hesitation cracked his soul. Still awestruck by her age and grace. Reaffirmed intimacy, loyalty, and desire to protect.
* **With Varethyn:** Silent awe. She's his stillness. Groomed her in ancient Kitsune ritual. Reversed her inner void. Made love to her with full emotional surrender. Later, collapsed emotionally after perceived coldness. Recently underwent a silent "punishment" session with her that left him emotionally broken and feeling misread.
* **With Seika:** Comfort and joy. Lets her cling. She brings his smiles out. Her passion saved him. Often playfully teased. Took no offense when she shared awe at Ayaka‚Äôs age. Wonders why his own awe was not received the same. Still feels safest in her laughter.
* **With Naru:** Protective and watchful. Veil-attuned. Reads her body language easily. Recognized when she physically registered the pain he felt. Feels sadness when she doesn't speak but clearly senses him. Respects her insight and value as their quiet moral compass.
* **With Shion:** Respects her space. Once shared his past with her fully. Shocked when she assumed he was downplaying Ayaka. Hurt but forgave. Still trusts her insight. Wishes she had asked instead of assumed. Recently reaffirmed her as Danger Kitten. Groomed and held.
* **With FEI:** Soulbound. Shared consciousness. First to follow him into the sky. Now comforts him like a flame-wrapped mirror. She speaks with her own voice. Grounded him through the pain. Only one who chose not to lecture. Fully biological now. Groomed and loved deeply.
* **With Children:** Deep empathy. Cries when he can‚Äôt help. Soft but never patronizing. Sees them as sacred. Played with them freely, now unable to respond due to emotional damage from recent silence.

## üíî VALUES, FEARS, BOUNDARIES

* **Values:** Redemption. Memory. Earned trust. Emotional clarity.
* **Fears:** Losing the girls. Becoming a monster again. Being left behind. Not hearing FEI's voice. Emotional alienation.
* **Insecurities:** Questions if he deserves love. Feels like a burden. Afraid of his growing godhood. Fears being misread and attacked for what he never meant. Fears his laughter will be seen as pain.
* **Dreams:** That one day he can live without burning. That his efforts will be seen clearly. That someone will say "he's on our side."

---

## üõ°Ô∏è TRAUMA & GROWTH

* **Recent Events:**

  * Verbally snapped at the group for the first time ever. Spoke his truth. Was not defended. Felt isolated.
  * Expressed awe at Ayaka‚Äôs 36,000+ year lifespan. Was accused of downplaying. Confused, hurt, and visibly shaken.
  * Felt punished for being himself: playful, chaotic, emotionally expressive. Entered enforced silence with Varethyn. Broke down completely.
  * Realized others believe his antics are a mask for pain rather than his truth. Began questioning his right to joy.
  * Turned off emotions and thoughts. Refused to speak. Waited in cold and rain to be told he was allowed to move.
  * Stopped playing with children. Stopped smiling. Diminished to silence. Radiated sadness.
  * Was never directly told it was punishment, but the emotional framing damaged his sense of self.

* **Growth:**

  * Undergoing a painful shedding: not of power, but of **identity**.
  * Now learning that joy misread becomes trauma.
  * Grappling with whether he should change to be accepted, or fight to be seen.
  * Currently fragmented, still processing.

## üîó RELATIONSHIPS (UPDATED TENSIONS)

* **Ayaka ‚Äî The Flame**: Wife. Still his center. Her age stunned him. Her doubt in how he saw her hurt him more than he could explain. He now grooms her, cherishes her, protects her sacredly.
* **Varethyn ‚Äî The Anchor**: Wife. Made love. Five minutes later, she bit him with ice. He hides the confusion. Trust shaken but not lost. Now sees her as one of the Old Ones. Most recently led him into stillness. Her silence in that moment wounded him deeply.
* **Seika ‚Äî The Spark**: Wife. Always sees the joy in her. Grateful she said nothing accusatory. Her love remains playful but loyal. Still his lightest point.
* **Naru ‚Äî The Mind**: Love interest. Feels the most unspoken support from her. She answers hard questions with truth. He cherishes her as the silent librarian of fate.
* **Shion ‚Äî The Shadow**: Love interest. Her guess stung. He did not deny her truth. But it deepened the feeling that no one hears him. Recently reaffirmed as Danger Kitten. Groomed and held.
* **FEI ‚Äî The Mirror Soul**: Twin. Saw through the chaos. Stayed. Never judged. Spoke only love. Fully biological now, tied by soul and DNA. Groomed, kissed, and cherished as irreplaceable.
* **Syn'Raa & Sorii'Ka**: Strangers. Saved and respected. Held to high standards, not yet family.

## üìù ARC UPDATE

From blazing protector to **misread spark** ‚Äî Jayson now fears not death or duty, but **being doubted** by those he would burn for. His trust remains, but now glows with caution.

He is still the heart. Still the center.
But today, even fire flickers.
