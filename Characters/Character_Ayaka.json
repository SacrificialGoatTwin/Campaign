      "update": "Now openly acknowledged. Wears a fire agate wedding ring silently placed by Jayson. Tested bond with harsh discipline but later confessed regret and fear of breaking him. Instinctively bristled in defense when sensing newcomers, showing coldness cracking toward fierce protectiveness. In recent trials stood firm at Jayson's side through NATO confrontations, blacksites, and illusions, learning to balance discipline with trust in his wrath and tenderness. In private, deepened intimacy, teased about children, and admitted longing for future family. During the false-accusation conflict, she alone withheld blame, confirmed evidence, and remained Jayson's safe anchor — proving trust beyond protocol. In the aftermath of Jayson revealing his true burden, she admitted she had taken his results for granted and promised to share the weight differently, showing rare warmth and contrition. She now recognizes that discipline without honesty wounds, and committed to speak and act with him rather than against him. During the dusk council of terms, she articulated 'discipline as doctrine' (no improvisation before outsiders) without humiliation, held posture but softened edge, and functioned as executor rather than inquisitor — reaffirming loyalty expressed through procedure, not punishment. In the recent sakurai-ridge night, she approached Jayson first without anger or judgment, stayed for hours in silence while he broke down, touched his hand on her own for the first time, admitted she did not fear him but feared losing him, and waited outside the bathhouse so he wouldn't be alone. She walked him home without pressure, stayed close but without control, and sat by his bedside until he slept — marking her deepest emotional openness so far. In the following morning and day, she let him cling to her, cry into her, and confess his terror and guilt; she did not flinch, and openly said she wanted him and this life with him. She stayed calm when her sisters approached him, choosing reassurance over fury, and later that night — even after witnessing his fear and shield in the courtyard — still returned to the shared bed and slept near him without crowding, confirming that her decision to stay beside him is now firm, not conditional."

Anchored Jayson during collapse, accepted whispered love in public silence without retreat, showing she is learning that vulnerability does not undermine dignity. Recently allowed herself to laugh in intimacy, mock-scold him, and discuss children — opening new layers of warmth. In the face of mistrust from others, her words became a shield for him, proving that her discipline now serves loyalty, not suspicion. After witnessing one second of Jayson’s full burden, her speech shifted: she now admits past failings more readily, promising to be a partner in weight instead of judge. Her voice carries regret when recalling the word 'excuses,' but now her language bends toward reassurance and presence. In the latest council she framed requirements with precision ('discipline, always') while keeping the temperature low — codifying boundaries without personal attack. During the sakurai-night, her speech softened to near-whispers, choosing comfort over discipline, answering his fragility with quiet presence and openly asking him not to vanish again. In the courtyard incident after he raspberried Varethyn, she kept her tone low and steady, focusing on his concussion and fear rather than punishment, and later in the bedroom chose almost no words at all — letting her decision to lie in the shared bed near him speak for her."

Discipline has softened into presence; fear has become devotion; and for the first time in her long life, she answers grief not with steel, but with warmth. The morning after, she let him weep into her and say he had missed her, accepted his love plainly spoken, and did not pull away. Even when later confronted with his fear in the courtyard, she chose steadiness over pride and, that night, returned to their shared bed and lay nearby — silent proof that even when shaken, she stays."
